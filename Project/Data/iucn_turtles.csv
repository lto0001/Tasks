Malaclemys terrapin,"<p>                      </p><p><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> is found in brackish coastal waters (salinity range = 0 to <a style=""mso-comment-reference: WMR_1;mso-comment-date:20161231T0810"">35</a>). Typical habitats include coastal regions, estuaries, lagoons, tidal creeks, mangrove swamps, and salt marshes. In coastal estuaries supporting large watersheds, terrapins can occur far inland up to the terminal end of the salt wedge (e.g., Chesapeake Bay, Hudson River, and Pamlico Sound). Although <em>M. terrapin</em> is found in brackish water, periodic access to freshwater is necessary for long-term health, and populations in high salinity habitats actively seek and drink freshwater which is essential for neonate survival and growth (Dunson 1985; Holliday <em>et al</em>. 2009) and may be a contributing factor to the semi-terrestrial behavior of neonates to 3-year-olds.&#160;Hatchlings are exceptionally desiccation tolerant (Figueras <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>The diet of <em>M. terrapin</em> consists largely of invertebrates, crustaceans, and mollusks (Tucker <em>et al</em>. 1995, 2018) and a variety of plant materials and algae (Tulipani 2015; Erazmus <em>et al</em>. 2018). In some populations terrapins are predators of the Salt Marsh Periwinkle (<em>Littoraria irrorata</em>), a snail that grazes on epiphytes that grow on Salt Marsh Cord Grass (<em>Spartina alterniflora</em>). Silliman and Bertness (2002) demonstrated through a series of experiments that when periwinkle predators were removed, periwinkles damage and kill cord grass, leaving a barren mudflat and increasing marsh erosion rates. Although terrapins were not removed or tested in this experiment, as a periwinkle predator they are frequently identified as a potential saltmarsh keystone species. This extrapolation suggests that healthy terrapin populations play a role in maintaining primary production in salt marsh ecosystems and stabilizing shoreline vegetation, thus reducing local erosion.<br/><br/><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> exhibits considerable variation in size, sexual size dimorphism, and reproductive output throughout its range. In general, along the Atlantic sea board there is a gradient of increasing body size, greater sexual dimorphism, later ages of maturity, and higher reproductive output with increasing latitude (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Gulf Coast populations do not conform to this latitudinal variation and are larger than their counterparts on the Atlantic Coast at the same latitude. Most comprehensive life history data come from long-term studies of populations in South Carolina, Maryland, and New York, with limited data from other parts of the range focused mostly on reproductive output and females. Nonetheless, the differences in morphological and life history traits contribute to different environmental stressors and management strategies relevant to terrapin populations throughout the range. Careful modeling is needed to compare reproductive traits among populations to assess how total annual reproductive output per individual varies along the latitudinal gradient.<br/><br/>Diamondback Terrapins under natural conditions exhibit high adult survivorship, low reproductive rates, and high egg/juvenile mortality characteristic of most temperate turtles (Mitro 2003). As a consequence of this suite of life history traits, increases in adult mortality result in declining populations (Congdon <em>et al</em>. 1993, 1994). Marked variation in life history traits can be attributed to a broad latitudinal distribution (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Females from northern populations mature later and at a relatively larger size than those from southern populations. Clutch size and body size appear to be somewhat correlated over the range; females from New York average 12.8 eggs per clutch (Burke <em>et al</em>. 2018), Maryland females may produce as many as 26 eggs per clutch (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data), and smaller females from more southern populations produce only 4–6 eggs per clutch (Seigel 1984). Average annual reproductive output depends on the number of clutches produced per season. In Chesapeake Bay populations, the average female may produce 1–3 clutches of about 13 eggs in a single nesting season (13–40 eggs/year) and detailed nesting data suggest that terrapins rarely forgo nesting annually, but the number of clutches per year may vary (Roosenburg and Dunham 1997). For detailed reviews of reproductive data, see Roosenburg (1994), Butler <em>et al</em>. (2006a, 2006b), Brennessel (2006), Ernst and Lovich (2009), and Lovich <em>et al</em>. (2018).<br/><br/><em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> demonstrates marked sexual dimorphism, most likely as a fecundity advantage (Carr 1952), with females being considerably larger, with maximum reported population mean female carapace length of 20.1 cm and male carapace length of 13.3 cm (reviewed in Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Female terrapins can reach weights over 2.5 kg in northern populations, but males rarely exceed 0.5 kg throughout the range (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). The maximum recorded size for an adult female, 32 cm carapace length, is much greater than that of males, 16 cm, from the same population, and the discrepancy between male and female size increases with latitude (W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). Female terrapins mature later and at a larger size than males. The resulting difference in body size is more pronounced in more northern populations. Size differences result in differences in jaw morphology and bite forces that likely contribute to resource partitioning (diet, habitat) between the sexes (Tucker <em>et al</em>. 1995; Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 1999; Herrel <em>et al</em>. 2018). Throughout their geographic range, population means for hatchlings range from 25–38 mm in carapace length and 6.3–8.8 g in mass (reviewed in Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018). Maturity is reached at 4–13 years of age in females, and 2–7 years in males, depending on location (see summary in Brennessel 2006). Longevity may be greater than 40 years for some individuals; marked adult females have been recaptured 30 years after their initial capture as adults (R.C. Wood, unpubl. data; W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). Generation time has not been reported in the published literature; available information indicates that it ranges from 13 to 20 years and also increases with increasing latitude (Mitro 2003; W.M. Roosenburg, unpubl. data). Generation times in more southern populations are shorter, as maturity at lower latitudes is attained several years earlier (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Nesting requirements vary among subpopulations (Roosenburg 1994, Butler <em>et al</em>. 2018). <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> embryos have temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), with females produced at higher incubation temperatures, generating&#160;important differences between populations (Jeyasuria <em>et al</em>. 1994; Burke and Calichio 2014). The challenges of climate change, combined with sea level rise and nesting habitat loss (Michener <em>et al</em>. 1997, Woodland <em>et al</em>. 2017) could potentially affect sex ratios in populations. The conservation challenges associated with climate change and TSD as it affects sex ratios generates new concerns for the effective management of terrapin populations throughout their range, particularly when integrated with the nesting habitat loss due to development (Seigel and Gibbons 1995).<br/><br/>Terrapin hatchlings in northern parts of the range also facultatively overwinter in the nest, suggesting that the nesting environment is critical habitat throughout the entire year (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2018; Graham 2009; Kitson 2016). Post-emergence neonate habitat is poorly known, but after emergence, some hatchlings move to shallow, self-excavated hibernacula in upland areas (Draud <em>et al</em>. 2004, Duncan and Burke 2016) before moving into intertidal marshes where they may remain semi-terrestrial well into their second growing season (Muldoon and Burke 2012). Adult terrapins hibernate communally in depressions in the mud at the bottom of tidal creeks and embayments protected from prevailing weather (Haramis <em>et al</em>. 2011), in undercut banks within the tidal zone, or burrow into creek banks (Yearicks <em>et al</em>. 1981). Southern subspecies (e.g., <em>M. t. rhizophorarum</em>) may be active throughout the winter.</p><br/><p></p>","<p>In the early 1900s, populations of <em>Malaclemys terrapin</em> were in danger of extinction due to intense commercial harvest for human consumption (Hay 1917). Although pre-harvest population data are lacking, many populations had recovered to some extent by the late 20th century and <em>M. terrapin</em> was listed as Lower Risk/Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List in 1996 (Kennedy 2018b). However, data from long-term studies (Avissar 2006; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007; Roosenburg 2004; Wood and Herlands 1997) suggest that many terrapin populations are again in decline. Effects that contribute to observed declines in well-studied subpopulations (ongoing habitat loss/degradation, crab pot mortality, subsidized nest predation, and road mortality) are ubiquitous and likely to have a similar effect throughout the terrapin’s range (Seigel and Gibbons 1995). Low recruitment due to high nest predation, juvenile and adult male mortality in crab pots and high adult female mortality from vehicle collisions and crab pots in southern populations are cause for alarm because population models suggest a stable population requires both modest recruitment and, most importantly, high adult survival (Roosenburg 2004; Mitro 2003).<br/><br/>In Kiawah, South Carolina, population estimates from a mark-recapture study of <em>M. terrapin</em><span class=""datalabel1""> suggest a decline of 75% over the last two decades (Gibbons <em>et al</em>. 2001; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007). High male and juvenile mortality rates in this population, likely due to incidental drowning in crab pots, result in an increase in the proportion of large females in the population (Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007). Similarly, crab pots have been suggested to cause female biased sex ratios (Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 1997) and potentially driving the evolution of male body size (Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010) in Chesapeake Bay. Similar levels of decline have been observed in the adult female population during a 20 year population study in the Patuxent River of Chesapeake Bay. Factors contributing to the decline in the Patuxent population include commercial harvest, bycatch mortality in commercial fisheries, an oil spill, and nesting habitat loss (W.M. Roosenburg, <span class=""datalabel1"">unpubl<span class=""datalabel1"">.<span class=""datalabel1""> data<span class=""datalabel1"">).<br/><br/>Commercial and recreational use of crab pots continues to be the major contributing factor to the population declines from New Jersey to Texas (Bishop 1983; Wood 1997; Roosenburg 2004; Dorcas <em>et al</em>. 2007; Seigel and Gibbons 1994; Chambers and Maerz 2018). Populations in Chesapeake Bay have female biased sex ratios due to the impact of crab pots (Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010; Roosenburg <em>et al</em>. 1997) in addition to compensatory growth and changed size structure as a consequence of continued crab pot mortality (Wolak <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent work has suggested that even a single crab pot in a tidal creek or local area can drive population declines (Lovich <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In estuaries near Tuckerton,&#160;New Jersey, road mortality contributed to a significant decline in the number of adult females over 13 years (Avissar 2006). This demographic shift was not attributed to crab pot mortality because the site is closed to crabbing; however, a decline in large females is consistent with the observation that road mortality of nesting females had increased (Avissar 2006; Szerlag and McRobert 2006). A long-term study on the Cape May Peninsula of southernmost New Jersey documented 4,020 road kills during a 7-year period (Wood and Herlands 1997). As of 2011, the total number of roadkills at this study site has surpassed 10,000 adult females (R.C. Wood, unpubl. data). The terrapin population decline during this time is unknown, but is likely substantial because the area also has a significant commercial and recreational crab fishery (Wood 1997). Similarly in Georgia, small tidal creeks impacted by commercial crabbing and nearby roads had reduced terrapin populations relative to creeks more isolated from these threats (Grosse <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>New York’s largest terrapin populations inhabit the heavily-urbanized Jamaica Bay. Researchers observed over 2,000 nests on one island in this study area in 1998 (Feinberg and Burke 2003). Recruitment is low because annual nest predation rates, primarily by raccoons, vary from 92-100%. The number of nests laid per year declined 43% from 1999-2011 (Feinberg and Burke 2003; R.L. Burke, unpubl. data) and the nesting terrapin population has experienced a 55% decline from 1998 to 2017 (R.L. Burke and Roe, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Little is known about terrapin populations along the Gulf Coast. Historical accounts suggest large populations once existed in this part of the range, but overexploitation has reduced populations which are slow to recover in the face of heavy crabbing pressure (Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014). Dauphine Island, Alabama, formerly supported a significant terrapin fishery which currently remains as a relic population (Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2014). Recent studies in Louisiana have discovered subpopulations in the Rockefeller National Wildlife Refuge and its adjoining bayous and in Barataria Bay, but detailed population and life history data are lacking from this area (Selman <em>et al</em>. 2014, Pearson and Wiebe 2018). Small populations are also known from Galveston Bay, Texas, but the combination of development and pollution has reduced the available habitat to a few small islands within the bay (V. Guillory, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Bermuda’s terrapin population is estimated at about 100 individuals and recruitment is low, caused by low nest success (Outerbridge 2014). The reasons for developmental failure are not known, but could be due to insecticides and herbicides used around the only wetland where terrapins are found (M.E. Outerbridge, pers. comm.).</span></span></p>",Decreasing,Nearctic,Vulnerable,2018-06-03 00:00:00 UTC
Malacochersus tornieri,"<em>Malacochersus tornieri</em>&#160;is a small, flat, and soft-shelled tortoise of up to about 17.8 cm carapace length, rarely weighing more than 500 g. It has a flat and pliable shell resulting from limited bony shell development with a covering of thin keratinous scutes. The flat shape and shell pliability are fundamental adaptations which have enabled the species to successfully utilize rock crevice microhabitats in East Africa.&#160;It is an inhabitant of arid thorn-bush and savanna landscapes, where it lives on hills with rocky outcrops (kopjes) (Loveridge and Williams 1957; Broadley 1989; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018). Superimposing the species’ distribution map and vegetation maps of Spawls <em>et al</em>. (2002) indicates the species to inhabit predominantly dry savanna regions with 250 to 500 mm annual rainfall, with populations ranging into adjacent areas of semi-desert as well as moist savanna. Individual Pancake Tortoises are usually found in fissures and crevices in and between boulders and bedrock. Remarkable places in which some animals have been found include fissures high up in towering rocks, and in vertical clefts in boulders where tortoises have to climb up the boulder and slide down into the cleft (Broadley 1989).&#160;It is associated with isolated rocky hills and outcrops (kopjes) within its range, where it hides in crevices between and under exfoliating slabs of pre-Cambrian rock (gneiss) where it has a limited home range and exhibits high site fidelity&#160;(Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018). The species is not a migrant, but periodic, local movement between crevices has been observed (Moll and Klemens 1996; Malonza 2003; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Pancake Tortoises are reported to eat a variety of herbs and succulent plants, and to like flowers. Analysis of faeces has shown that they also eat tenebrionid and scarabid beetles (Spawls <em>et al</em>. 2002). Loveridge and Williams (1957) noted that the species apparently emerges to feed only during the early morning hours. Due to the cryptic nature of the species, most information on reproduction derives from a mixture of <em>in situ</em> wild observations, <em>in situ</em> captive observations, and general captive observations. Mating has been recorded in the range in January and February, and a single or occasionally two large elongate eggs are laid annually at the beginning of the rainy season&#160;(Spawls <em>et al</em>. 2002; Schmidt 2006; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;Hatchlings measure 32–47 mm straight carapace length and weigh about 10–23 g (Shaw 1970; Wilke 1984; Ewert <em>et al</em>. 2004; Dathe 2005).","The status of <em>Malacochersus tornieri</em>&#160;subpopulations in the wild is incompletely known, but many are decreasing (Honegger 1964; Klemens and Moll 1995; Malonza 2003; Ngwava 2015; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018). Species abundance varies from one area to another and appears to be a function of habitat quality, including the presence of appropriately oriented and well-exfoliated rock crevices with suitable interior dimensions (Moll and Klemens 1996, Malonza 2003). Other aspects of microhabitat quality include the degree of herbaceous vegetation cover over rock outcrops (Malonza 2003;&#160;Mwaya 2009), and the extent of anthropogenic habitat alteration (Wood and MacKay 1997; Chansa and Wagner 2006; Kyalo 2008). Low tortoise&#160;population densities in otherwise seemingly suitable habitat also result from removal and offtake by commercial collectors (Klemens and Moll 1995; Malonza 2003; Ngwava 2015; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In Kenya, recorded species densities in appropriate habitats have ranged from 8.86 tortoises/km<sup>2</sup> in Voo, Kitui County (Malonza 2003), to as low as 1.2 tortoises/km<sup>2</sup> in Nguni, Kitui County (Malonza 2003, Kyalo 2008). The low density in the Nguni area was due to past collection, as this was the only area where the species was earlier known to occur in Kenya (Wood and MacKay 1997). However, even relatively high-density subpopulations such as those at Voo can become rapidly depleted. Ngwava (2015) found no Pancake Tortoises there when resurveying Voo in 2014. Notably, a commercial farming operation for Pancake Tortoises had been established near Voo and was still operational in 2014; it is likely that the local wild population may have been collected to provide some breeding stock for the farm (Ngwava 2015; Mwaya <em>et al</em>. 2018). A few other areas in Kenya surveyed by Malonza (2003) that had good Pancake Tortoise subpopulations at that time were also noted by Ngwava (2015) to be depleted in 2014. In Tanzania, commercial Pancake Tortoise farms inspected by Malonza (2001) appeared to be conduits for wild-collected animals.&#160;<br/><br/>In Zambia, 66 animals were found at eight sites in Nakonde District which were inhabited by 2–25 individuals per site (Chansa and Wagner 2006). Based upon a mark-recapture study conducted at eight sites in suitable habitat at Nakonde District, a population size estimate of 518 animals was obtained by ZAWA (2000) and a density of 11 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> (Chansa and Wagner 2006).",Decreasing,Afrotropical,Critically Endangered,2018-10-25 00:00:00 UTC
Pelusios niger,"<em>Pelusios niger</em>&#160;occurs in the rainforest region in a variety of standing and slow-flowing permanent waters, including lakes, lagoons, and marshes, as well as rivers (Trape <em>et al</em>. 2012; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is often seen on land and can also be found in ephemeral waterbodies, especially during the wet season (Trape <em>et al</em>. 2012). It feeds on shellfish, mollusks, fish and aquatic vegetation (Luiselli 2008; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2018). Data available on the reproductive biology of <em>P. niger</em> in the field are scarce. A female of 22 cm CL had a clutch of 10 eggs measuring 47–49 mm long and 24–25 mm wide, with a mass of 17–18 g each (Maran and Pauwels 2005). In the Niger Delta of southern Nigeria, clutch size ranged from 18–28 with an average of 25 ± 2, and eggs measured 30–40 mm in length (mean, 35.5 ± 4 mm) (Akani <em>et al</em>. 2015c). Mean hatchling size was 40 × 33 mm carapace length and width (F. Grünewald, unpubl. data). Age at maturity is probably about 6-8 years at carapace lengths of ca. 10-12 cm (males) and about 15 cm (females), generation time is estimated to be about 15 years, and longevity is at least 20-25 years. Maximum size of females is about 26.5 cm carapace length, and males are larger, reaching about 34.7 cm in carapace length (Maran 2006). Weight varies considerably among individuals, however, an average female of about 20 cm carapace length may be 1100-1300 g, whereas an average male of about 26 cm carapace length may be 2,100-2,300 g with captive individuals being slightly heavier (F. Grünewald, unpubl. data).","<p><em>Pelusios niger</em> is a species of limited distribution, poorly represented in museum collections, although sometimes reaching high local abundance, as in the swamps and coastal streams of Gabon and Nigeria (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2018). Local declines appear to have occurred at some sites in the Niger Delta of southern Nigeria. For instance, the species tends to be quickly extirpated from sites subjected to oil spillages (Luiselli and Akani 2003; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2006a). Overall, there is no evidence yet that population declines rangewide are generalized in a major way, although no long-term monitoring data on any natural populations are available. However, much of its natural habitat, which includes water bodies within the forest block of eastern coastal West Africa and coastal Cameroon and Gabon (Maran 2006) is under severe threat due to industrial expansion and deforestation (Akani <em>et al</em>. 1999; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2000), and population declines of at least 10-15% over the last 30 years (two generations) are estimated.</p>",Decreasing,Afrotropical,Near Threatened,2018-05-20 00:00:00 UTC
Cycloderma aubryi,"<p>               <em>Cycloderma aubryi</em>&#160;is primarily an inhabitant of large freshwaters within the tropical rainforest biome, with a few records known from the wet savanna region to the south. It is occasionally found in small streams and temporary pools. Within larger water bodies, it specifically seeks out areas with emerging shrubs and vegetation in sheltered coves and embayments, while reedbeds are also used. Hatchlings and juveniles utilize flooded forest habitats. All known localities are below 500 m altitude (review by Gramentz 2008).&#160;<em>Cycloderma aubryi</em>&#160;feeds on fish, crab and crayfish; juveniles are thought to feed on insects as well (Gramentz 1999, 2008; Maran 2002; Maran and Pauwels 2005).&#160;<em>Cycloderma aubryi</em>&#160;reaches at least 50 cm SCL and 15 kg, and females may exceed 60 cm and 18 kg&#160;(overview by Gramentz 2008). Females were considered to reach maturity at 30-35 cm SCL and 3.0-4.5 kg (Gramentz 2008). Clutches comprise 17-34 eggs; two clutches may be produced per year (Maran 2002, Maran and Pauwels 2005).    </p>","<p>               <em>Cycloderma aubryi</em>&#160;was found during surveys in Salonga National Park in the Congo, DRC (Diagne 2013) and is considered locally common in the lower Ogooué River of Gabon (L. Chirio and O. Pauwels unpubl. data). Anecdotal information strongly indicates that populations have declined significantly, at least locally and likely across much of the range, as a result of collection for local consumption (Maran 2002; Maran and Pauwels 2005; Pauwels and Maran 2007, 2009; Gramentz 2008).&#160;    </p>",Decreasing,Afrotropical,Vulnerable,2016-06-13 00:00:00 UTC
Stigmochelys pardalis,"<p></p><p>Habitat varies greatly over this species' large range, and Leopard Tortoises utilize the most habitat types of any sub-Saharan species (Branch, 2008). Habitats include karroid fynbos in the south to mesic thicket, arid and mesic savanna, thorn scrub, and grassland as you move northeastward in the range. Leopard Tortoises can be found from sea-level to about 2,900 m altitude (Hailey and Coulson 1995, Mason <em>et al</em>. 2000, Malonza <em>et al</em>. 2006, Branch, 2008).<br/><br/>Diet includes a wide variety of plants such as seasonal annuals, grasses, succulents and forbs (parts include leaves, flowers, seeds). Occasional ingestion of dried carcass, bone, ash, or feces has also been observed (Milton 1992, Rall and Fairall 1993, Kabigumila 2001, Busson and Loehr 2011).&#160;<em>Stigmochelys</em>&#160;is known to be an important seed disperser in Addo Elephant National Park, where its biomass exceeds that of most other herbivores. As it does not “chew cud” like most mammalian herbivores, seeds pass intact through the digestive tract. It is therefore of greater significance as a seed-disperser than ungulates (Milton 1992, Mason 1995).<br/><br/>Size tends to vary geographically with larger individuals in mesic habitat at both the northern and southern extremes of its range (individuals known to reach up to 70 cm). In the central savanna of East Africa animals are around 30-45 cm (Lambert 1995, Branch 2008, Fritz <em>et al</em>. 2010). Females grow faster than males, females are heavier, and tortoises reach sexual maturity at about 12 to 15 years. Tortoise are known to live from 30 to 75 years in captivity (Boycott and Bourquin 2000, Branch 2008). Nesting takes place from May to June or from October to November depending on latitude. Female Leopard Tortoises lay 6-15 (exceptionally up to 30) spherical hard-shelled eggs and may have multiple clutches (3-7) during a breeding season. Incubation period varies from 8-15 months depending on temperatures (Bonin <em>et al</em>. 2006, Branch 2008).<br/><br/>Natural predators on young/eggs include monitor lizards, snakes, honey badgers, jackals, mongoose, eagles, and crows; however, adult tortoises have also been reported to be preyed upon by lions in Kruger National Park and hyena in Bwabwata National Park (Broadley 1989, Bonin <em>et al</em>. 2006, Branch, 2008, Hanssen and Cunningham, 2012).</p><p></p>","<p> Overall population estimates for this species are unknown but Bonin <em>et al</em>. (2006) refer to populations as being “still numerous”. McDougal (2000) reported that tortoises across their range are rare in regions with high human populations (overharvesting) and consequently in areas with low human populations, tortoise populations are “apparently secure”. This species was recorded in consistently high numbers in northern Tanzania (Kabigumila 2001) and is common in most Tanzanian protected areas (J. Kabigumila and Mwaya pers. comms. at workshop August 2013). Boycott and Bourquin (2000) considered this species to be in low densities over its range in South Africa. A study in the Thicket Biome of the Eastern Cape in South Africa found a density of 0.85 tortoises per hectare (Mason <em>et al</em>. 2000). A population estimate of 57.6 ± 4.0 tortoises in a 5,500 ha area was obtained in a study done in the semi-arid Nama-Karoo, South Africa and this is a lower density than populations found in more mesic areas (McMaster and Downs 2006). Population numbers in East African savanna habitat may be lower than in the more mesic northern (Ethiopian highlands) and southern (Thicket biome, South Africa) habitats where fire is not a dominant component of ecosystems. Overall there is no evidence of range contractions or local extinctions (Branch 2008). Participants at the Sub-Saharan African tortoise &amp; freshwater turtle red listing workshop (August 2013) considered that the species is generally common in southern Africa, where it is subject to a variety of threats, but not at levels where impacts on populations have been documented. &#160; </p>",Unknown,Afrotropical,Least Concern,2014-08-29 00:00:00 UTC
Pelochelys signifera,"<p><em>Pelochelys signifera</em>&#160;is a large and highly aquatic softshell that occupies the larger rivers, wetlands, estuaries and coastal regions under freshwater influence, within its range. It probably occasionally enters the near-coastal marine environment, as both&#160;<em>P. bibroni</em>&#160;in southern New Guinea and&#160;<em>P. cantorii</em>&#160;in southeastern Asia enter the marine environment on a regular basis (Rhodin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1993, Das 2008).

Mesoclemmys hogei,"<em>Mesoclemmys hogei</em> is a highly aquatic species that inhabits lakes and small rivers; juveniles have been reported from small streams.

Mature females nest between January and April, producing clutches of 5-11 eggs (Drummond and Coutinho unpubl. data). The age at maturity is estimated at around 15 years (Drummond and Coutinho 2011). Similar to other medium-sized chelid turtles, a minimum generation time of 20 years appears appropriate.</span></span></span>","Most of the known localities for this species have been sampled since 1992, and only two thriving populations are still found in the Carangola and Paraíba do Sul Rivers, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, respectively (Drummond and Coutinho 2009). At all other sites less than five turtles were collected and, at most sites none were found at all. Studies in the Carangola River started in 1992, when an index of population size was first obtained based on capture success using Fike nets in an area of 5.0 km of river stream. From October 2000 to June 2002 the same methodology was applied along the 150 km of the Carangola River, from the headwaters to the estuary, and turtles were captured in about 40 km of the main channel (Moreira 2003).&#160;From October 2008 to December 2015, the same area was sampled and turtles were found in only 15 km of the main Carangola River (Drummond <em>et al</em>. 2011;&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Drummond <em>et al</em>. unpubl. data).&#160;The total number of turtles captured ranged from 20 in 1992 to 147 in 2015, but capture success, calculated as the number of turtles captured by unit effort, decreased steadily from 0.71 in 1992 to 0.05 in 2015. The trend in the index of population size was calculated based on the regression slope (1-e<sup>-ß</sup>), showing that since 1992, the population in the Carangola River had been declining at a mean annual rate of 16.2%, and is expected to experience local extinction in less than seven years’ time if no conservation actions are adopted&#160;(Drummond <em>et al</em>. unpubl. data). Additionally, recent DNA studies revealed that the&#160;Carangola population had very low genetic variability, probably related to a bottleneck effect experienced in the past&#160;(Carvalho <em>et al</em>. unpubl. data).&#160;Given that the Carangola River is a strategic site to the conservation of&#160;<em>M. hogei</em>, we suggest that strong action should be taken in order to prevent further damage to the natural population and that the species' threat status be revised to Critically Endangered.",Decreasing,Neotropical,Critically Endangered,2016-02-25 00:00:00 UTC
Phrynops williamsi,"<em>Phrynops williamsi</em> inhabits lotic moving water habitats, notably shallow rocky streams with rapids, and smaller rivers, and in general does not inhabit large lentic deep stillwater habitats such as reservoirs or impoundments (Rhodin and Mittermeier 1983, Buskirk 1989, Kunz <em>et al</em>. 2018). The species often basks on exposed rocks in its riparian habitat, but not on sandbanks. The largest male recorded had a carapace length (CL) of 355 mm (Cabrera 1998), the largest female had 330 mm CL; hatchlings are about 35 mm CL. The smallest recorded male (with large tail) was 141 mm CL. Diet in the wild is unknown, but <em>P. williamsi</em> has a robust skull with relatively wide maxillary triturating surfaces which suggest that the species feeds primarily on small snails, bivalves, aquatic arthropods, and possibly scavenges on dead fish. Sexual maturity of females is estimated as 10-12 years, with nesting apparently occurring in the spring and summer (August/September through February/March). Clutch size in a female measuring 252 mm CL was nine eggs with an average egg size of 33.3 by 27.0 mm (Rhodin and Mittermeier 1983). Generation time is estimated as 15-20 years.","<p><em>Phrynops williamsi</em> is relatively inconspicuous and somewhat uncommon and many subpopulations tend to be small and isolated.

Podocnemis lewyana,"<p>Páez <em>et al</em>. (2009, 2012) provided an extensive review of the habitats and ecology of&#160;<em>P. lewyana</em>.&#160;The species<strong>&#160;</strong>is primarily seen along the banks of rivers, although it is also possible to find individuals in small tributaries, lagoons, and flooded areas connected to rivers. Individuals are often observed basking on banks or fallen trunks along the shoreline, either alone or in groups including various size classes (Gallego-Garcia and Castaño-Mora 2008; Restrepo <em>et al</em>. 2008<a>). Smaller individuals tend to occur in shallower, more turbid waters or in flooded pastures, with adults more selective of deeper, wider channels (Gallego-García and Castaño-Mora 2008; Páez <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015a).<br/></a><br/>Nesting occurs in sand or gravel beaches, as well as in banks and pastures during the months of low river levels. Mean clutch sizes is 22 eggs, with a range of 10-31 eggs (Dahl and Medem 1964; Medem 1965; Castaño-Mora 1986; Correa-Hernández 2006; Cano 2007; Gallego-García and Castaño-Mora 2008).&#160;                  Based upon a sample size of approximately 1000 individuals (Páez, unpubl. data) adult males on average measure 24.6 cm SCL (range 20-35 cm) with an average weight of 1.6 kg (range 0.7-4.3 kg), while adult females average 37 cm SCL (range 30-46 cm) and on average weigh 5.6 kg (range 2,2-10.4 kg). Hatchlings measure 42-46 mm SCL and weigh 16-22 gram. It has been documented that <em>P. lewyana</em> nests are laid in both the verano and veranillo low water periods each year, but it is not clear whether individual females nest in both periods each year. However, within each period, there is wide variance around the female size/clutch size regression. This often results in species where females of a given body size lay progressively smaller clutches when re-nesting during a nesting season. It is suspected that female <em>P. lewyana</em> in the study population deposited one or more nests during both nesting seasons each year.&#160;Males attain sexual maturity at approximately 20 cm SCL, corresponding to 3-4 years of age. Females first nest at 30 cm SCL, at an approximate age of 5-6 years old. The generation time is approximately 10 years (Páez <em>et al</em>. 2012, Ceballos <em>et al</em>. 2014, González-Zarate <em>et al</em>. 2014, Ortiz-Yusti <em>et al</em>. 2014, Sánchez-Ospina <em>et al</em>. 2014, Zapata <em>et al</em>. 2014, Restrepo <em>et al</em>. 2015, Gallego-García and Páez 2016, Páez <em>et al.</em> 2015a,b).&#160; According to Gallego-Garcia and Forero-Medina (in prep.), <em>P. lewyana</em> has high site fidelity, with males and females exhibiting comparable home range sizes (10.3 ha and 14.6 ha, respectively). In the middle Magdalena drainage, the main nesting season is during the primary dry season, from December to April, with a peak in March, and limited nesting also occurring in the secondary dry season from July to August. In the Prado River of the upper Magdalena drainage, the main nesting period is from June to September and a secondary nesting period occurs from December to May (Vargas-Ramirez, unpubl. data).

The only study that has estimated annual survival rates showed that they increase with body size (Páez <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2015a). &#160;Some populations in the upper San Jorge River have already been extirpated (Vargas-Ramirez <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;A quantitative analysis (Páez <em>et al</em>. 2015a) in the Magdalena River involving four years of mark-recapture effort in four sites estimated generation time as approximately 10 years, based on female body size growth data and mean size of nesting females. A projection matrix was constructed from the data from the four sites and a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis indicated the population was declining at an annual rate of 8.8%. An elasticity analysis indicated that the most important parameter for helping the population recover was survival of adults, followed by survival of other age classes, with survival of eggs and hatchlings having the least effect.

The species is declining in Turkey because of dams and sand quarries. A total of 17 individuals in 14 different habitats were observed in 30 days in Turkish tributaries of the Euphrates; no individuals were observed along the main arm of the Euphrates, since no suitable habitats were left for nesting or basking, indicating a strong reduction in the previously observed population there (Ayaz and Bayrakçı 2015).

Batagur baska,"<em>Batagur baska</em> is a highly aquatic turtle species, associated with estuarine river sections, with nesting taking place on large on sand banks. It feeds primarily on riverside plants and fruits, however, it also consumes molluscs and has been observed to accept a variety of animal matter in captivity (Moll 1980). Females mature at 45 cm carapace length and may reach 60 cm; males mature at around 40 cm carapace length and can reach up to 49 cm (Moll 1985). Breeding maturity may occur at an age of nine years in captivity, but requires up to 25 years in rivers with modest productivity (Moll 1980). Females only produce a single clutch per year of about 18-33 eggs (P. Praschag pers. comm. 2018).","<p>In the 1980s a moderate to large breeding population of <em>Batagur baska</em> was thought to exist in the Sunderbans of Bangladesh (Moll 1985).

Carettochelys insculpta,"In New Guinea,<em>&#160;Carettochelys insculpta</em>&#160;inhabits rivers, including their deltas and estuarine reaches, grassy lagoons, swamps, lakes, and waterholes of the southern lowlands (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2015a, b). In Australia, the species appears restricted to seasonally clear, shallow, continuously-flowing waters of the Daly drainage and to billabongs and plunge pools of the Alligator Rivers region (Webb <em>et al</em>. 1986; Georges and Kennett 1989; Doody <em>et al</em>. 2001a, 2002; Georges <em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;2008). The species is omnivorous, but feeds principally on fruits, leaves, and stems of riparian vegetation, and aquatic plants, with some molluscs, crustaceans, insects, fish, and mammals (likely eaten as carrion) also consumed (Georges <em>et al</em><em>.</em>&#160;2008, and references therein).&#160;<em>Carettochelys</em>&#160;females may reach up to 57 cm carapace length (CL) and mature at 38 cm CL (Daly River) to 41 cm (Kikori region) or larger. Maturity in females appears to be reached at about 25 yrs, with generation time of <em>ca</em> 30–40 years (Heaphy 1990).<br/> <br/>Female turtles nest gregariously at night on riverside or coastal marine sandbanks, and appear to produce two clutches every second year, with a non-reproducing year in between (Doody <em>et al</em>. 2003a, b, 2009; Georges <em>et al</em>. 2008). Depending on location, average clutch size ranges from 10 (Daly River, Australia) to 21 eggs (Kikori region, Papua New Guinea), with a range of 7 to 26 or more. This species exhibits embryonic diapause and temperature-dependent sex determination, with females produced at warmer temperatures and males at lower temperatures&#160;(Webb <em>et al</em>. 1986, Young <em>et al</em>. 2004). Hatching is triggered by anoxia associated with torrential rain or flooding of the nest,&#160;and can expedited by sibling vibrations&#160;(Doody <em>et al</em>. 2001b, 2012). Incubation duration averages 65 days in Papua New Guinea and 72 days on the Daly River in Australia.&#160;Hatchlings measure 41–56 mm CL and weigh 21–30 g. Natural egg loss rates can be high from predation (up to 25%), notably by goannas&#160;(Doody <em>et al</em>. 2006), and flooding (up to 20%), or intrinsic issues (infertility, developmental problems, also up to 20%) (Georges <em>et al</em>. 2008, and references therein). The invasion of Cane Toads in 2003 into the Daly River boosted <em>C. insculpta</em> recruitment by <em>ca</em> 20% via population declines of Yellow-spotted Monitor Lizards (Doody <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;Predation of adults occurs by Saltwater Crocodiles (<em>Crocodylus porosus</em>).","Although statements regarding&#160;<em>Carettochelys</em>&#160;<em>insculpta</em> populations vary substantially, the species appears to be reasonably common in suitable habitat, although there is wide variance from locally rare to locally abundant, and populations are decreasing. Population densities for<em> C. insculpta</em> in the upper reaches of the South Alligator River in Australia have been estimated at 33.8 ± 11.3 turtles/ha (equivalent to 67 turtles/km of channel) (Georges and Kennett 1989). These estimates are comparatively high, and turtle densities were probably inflated above the carrying capacity of the waters in which they were found because of seasonal contractions of their aquatic habitat (Georges <em>et al</em><em>. </em>1993). Population in northern Australia (representing about 10% of the global population)&#160;appeared stable in 2009, populations in New Guinea (ca. 90% of global populations) were under significant threats, especially in Indonesian Papua. A decline of <em>ca</em> 57% was reported in the Kikori delta of Papua New Guinea over a 30-yr period between 1980 and 2010 and is likely to also be representative of other regions in Papua New Guinea (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2011).",Decreasing,Australasian,Endangered,2017-05-28 00:00:00 UTC

The species is predominantly terrestrial and is not specifically associated with forest streams, though animals can swim relatively well and can be seen, at least in captivity, wallowing in shallow water or swampy areas. It is considered a cool forest turtle, with temperatures exceeding 28ºC often resulting in stress and poor incubation success in captive animals (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2011; McCormack, unpubl. data).&#160;<em>Cuora galbinifrons</em> is a medium-sized turtle, reaching up to 20 cm carapace length at a weight of about 800 to 1,200 grams.

Elsewhere for <em>C. galbinifrons</em>, only anecdotal relative population density data are available. All recent indications are that the species requires extensive search effort to encounter. During field surveys in Lao PDR in 1993–1999, encounter rates were at the order of one turtle per three months in the field for a herpetologist, and one <em>C. galbinifrons</em> per day when working with a trained turtle hunting dog in prime turtle habitat (Stuart and Timmins 2000). A great deal of survey work has been undertaken in Viet Nam between 2009–2012 focused on determining the range and priority habitat for <em>C. galbinifrons.</em> Anecdotal information from interviews throughout the range inferred that historic quantities of the species available for collection in the forest have been greatly reduced, with many hunters stating that while the species was common 7–15 years ago, it is now increasingly difficult to find. Corresponding increases in wholesale prices paid have been documented during interviews throughout the species range in Viet Nam (McCormack, unpubl. data). Whereas <em>C. galbinifrons</em> was observed in substantial quantities in illegal trade shipments in the 1990s and early 2000s, only sporadic animals are observed in recent years, even though hunter interviews indicate that collection effort has not decreased, but the encounter rate has dropped precipitously.

Acanthochelys pallidipectoris,"<p><em>Acanthochelys pallidipectoris</em> is a small freshwater turtle species that normally reaches carapace lengths of 12.8-16.2 cm (review by Vinke <em>et al</em>. 2011), with a maximum carapace length of 17.5 cm CL reported (female, holotype, Freiberg 1945). Females are a little larger and higher domed than males (Pazko and Hernando 2005). Fully-grown adults weigh about 400 g (Richard and Bertonatti, 1998). Hatchlings measure about 31 mm CL (Pazko and Hernando 2005, Métrailler 2008).<br/><br/>Reproduction is little-known in this species. Both males and females appear mature at about 13-14 cm CL and 325-400 g (Horne 1993). Mating occurs terrestrially during the short rainy season at the peak of the summer (Pazko and Hernando 2005, Gonzales&#160;<em>et al.</em>2006). Apparently a single clutch of 2-5 eggs is produced per year (Richard 1991, Horne 1993) in captive conditions, though it is likely that in the wild the species may only breed during optimal years. Age at maturity, longevity and generation length appear unknown for this species. Generation length is conservatively estimated at 15 years, by analogy with other small chelid turtle species inhabiting strongly seasonal arid habitats (e.g.&#160;<em>Pseudemydura umbrina</em>: &#160;Kuchling and Bradshaw, 1993).<br/><br/>The limitations of the arid habitat portions of the Chaco means that <em>A. pallidipectoris</em> only occurs in temporarily flooded lowlands of the dry shrub forest with impenetrable soils (clay) and river-bed-like depressions that provide shallow water collected during the infrequent but heavy summer rains (Pazko and Hernando 2005, Vinke <em>et al</em>. 2011; T. Vinke and S. Vinke pers. obs.). In Mendoza, Argentina, a non-native population of this species occurs in a network of small artificial lagoons and ponds (Richard 1999).<br/><br/>The active period is restricted to the rainy season (less than six months, sometimes only four months), between October and March. The animals hibernate during the cooler dry season, terrestrially under <em>Bromelia</em> spp. and <em>Aechma</em> in the Natural Park Chaco (Pazko and Hernando 2005).&#160;The species feeds on a variety of small aquatic prey, mainly insects but also spiders, tadpoles, fish, and small organisms from the water surface (Richard 1999).</p>","<p>Total population size of <em>Acanthochelys pallidipectoris</em> is unknown and no estimates have been published; in 1996 the species was assessed as Vulnerable under criterion D1 (&lt;1,000 mature individuals) and until today there is no evidence that this was an underestimation.<br/><br/>This species does not achieve high densities. It lives in extremely small populations (Richard 1999, Vinke <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even after heavy rains, they are not numerous. No more than three specimens were discovered in an area of about 10 km<sup>2</sup> even under optimal conditions like first heavy rain in spring (Vinke <em>et al</em>. 2011). The highest known number of individuals in a single population was observed in the National Park Chaco, Province of El Chaco, Argentina, with 21 specimens in an area of 13 ha, living in a dense net of shallow, ephemeral artificial and natural ponds (Paszko and Hernando 2005).</p>",Decreasing,Neotropical,Endangered,2014-07-12 00:00:00 UTC

Kinixys homeana,"Most of the data available on the habitat preferences of <em>K. homeana</em> populations are based on anecdotal observations and not on sound data. It is generally reported that this species occurs in forests all throughout its range, generally of a drier type than the forests inhabited by <em>K. erosa</em> (Ernst and Barbour 1989). According to Broadley (1989) it inhabits the lowland evergreen forest, and a similar habitat has been described in western Cameroon (Lawson 1993), where it is locally threatened by clearance of forest for cultivation (e.g., around Nfainchang; Lawson 1993).
<br/>
<br/>The most detailed study on the habitat preferences of <em>K. homeana</em> has been done in southern Nigeria. At a landscape scale, a statistical study (based on logistic regression of presence/absence data) revealed that Nigerian populations of <em>K. homeana</em> are habitat specialists, being linked to zones of secondary dry forest around mangroves and in zones with secondary swamp-forest (Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2000). Considering that in the Delta states these habitat types have declined dramatically during the last decades, falling from 2% of state area in 1976–78 to only 0.2% in 1993–95 (Geomatics 1996) due primarily to petrochemical expansion, it may be inferred that habitat loss represents a very serious reason of decline for these tortoises at a global scale. This supposition is reinforced by evidence that <em>K. homeana</em> needs closed forest canopy and shady microhabitats to avoid overheating, and shows behavioral thermoregulation in its avoidance of overheating (Luiselli 2005), i.e. allowing only short periods of exposure to the sun during movements between sunlit and shaded areas (Hailey and Coulson 1998, Luiselli 2005). Another potential limitation factor of habitat occupancy by <em>K. homeana</em> may be a potential for interspecific competition for food with the closely related <em>K. erosa</em>, which exhibits a wide overlap in terms of spatial use (Luiselli 2003b).
<br/>
<br/>At a local scale, Luiselli (2003a) demonstrated that the type of attitude of human communities towards tortoises may have very serious consequences on the habitat preferences of these animals, so that any generalization can be difficult. Luiselli (2003a) studied tortoise population ecology at six study areas with similar habitat characteristics in the eastern axis of the Niger Delta. In three areas, the tortoises had been worshipped by local communities for a long time as holy animals, whereas in three other areas they were actively hunted for subsistence. The habitat use by tortoises varied depending on the type of treatment by the indigenous people (hunting vs. veneration): in the veneration areas the tortoises were frequently found in disparate habitats (i.e., dense dry bush, sparse dry bush, riparian vegetation, swamps, and plantations; Luiselli 2003a). In the hunting areas the tortoises were found almost exclusively inside dense bush, and always avoided plantations. It seems likely that the different habitat usage reflects extirpation from easier hunting areas (Luiselli 2003a). This study may have important global consequences for this species' status, because it demonstrates that wherever they are hunted for subsistence (which is a common occurrence in West and Central Africa, e.g., see Fa <em>et al</em>. 2000, Lawson 2000, Fa and Garcia Juste 2001, Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2003), the habitat in which they are still found is just a fraction of the potential habitat. They are limited to forest patches with very dense vegetation where access for human hunters is difficult. Forest habitat loss is an enormous problem in West Africa because of the rate of destruction (Oates 1999), and concomitant with this, human overpopulation and increasing hunting pressure (e.g., Luiselli 2003a,c; Luiselli <em>et al</em>. 2003) means that the long-term viability of these tortoises is at high risk.
<br/>
<br/>Clearance of forest for cultivation is also considered a cause of decline for <em>K. homeana</em> in Cameroon (e.g., around Nfainchang; Lawson 1993). Although we do not have quantitative data for other countries it is obvious that the same is happening almost everywhere in the range of this tortoise, since in all these countries human population density is growing, forest loss is rapid, and hunting for subsistence is rampant (e.g., see discussion in Oates 1999).","There are no available data on the global population size and density of <em>K. homeana</em> at the continental scale. We therefore need to use the few data available on the density and home ranges of these tortoises from some specific localities to generate estimates of population size at the continental scale.
<br/>
<br/>In the Niger Delta (southern Nigeria), during 1995–2002, we radiotracked 33 adults (20 males and 13 females) for 40 continuous days, and measured mean home range size (quantified via minimum convex polygon) of 0.37 km² for males and 0.24 km² for females, with some specimens (especially males) exhibiting home ranges as large as 0.46 km². Lawson (2000) also stated that, in western Cameroon, male home range may exceed 0.5 km²; his data are very similar to our own despite the different study regions and environmental conditions. Moreover, both in Nigeria (Luiselli and associates unpublished data) and in Cameroon (Lawson 2000), male tortoises are highly territorial, and usually drive other males away from their core home ranges. Thus, the density of these tortoises is low in most places even in highly suitable environments. Luiselli (2003a) presented some data on population structure and abundance of <em>K. homeana</em> that can be useful for calculating a rough density of these tortoises under natural conditions. During 20 consecutive field days of research in southern Nigeria (10 days in the wet season and 10 days in the dry season, from February 2001 to January 2002) ten people independently searching a 20 ha area found an average density of 1.4 tortoises/ha at six localities. The density ranged from 0.15 to 0.9 tortoises/ha in harvest areas, and from 1.65 to 2.85 tortoises/ha in veneration areas (density values calculated from Table 1 in Luiselli, 2003a).
<br/>
<br/><em>K. homeana</em> is known to inhabit similar habitats across its entire range, and data from separate regions (Cameroon and Nigeria) showed a clear similarity also in home range size and territoriality. Hence we may use the above population density of approximately 1.4 individuals/ha for <em>K. homeana</em> in Nigeria to extrapolate estimates for the whole species range. Calculating population size from the population density estimates (Luiselli 2003a), we expect approximately 140 tortoises in an area of 1 km², which would give a figure of about 1,300,900 tortoises in all of Nigeria according to the most optimistic view (i.e., assuming that in 50% of the occupied sites there is veneration, and no hunting pressure). However, since our data show that veneration occurs in less than 1% of the occupied sites, the total tortoise population figure would be much lower. With an average density (calculated from Luiselli 2003a for harvest areas) of 0.53 individuals/ha this gives 53.33 tortoises/km², and about 500,000 tortoises in all of Nigeria. This latter figure is probably a much more accurate population estimate. If we apply the above reasoning to the whole of this species’ range we calculate a total population size for <em>K. homeana</em> of at best 4,205,000 tortoises.
<br/>
<br/>Lawson (2000), studying the harvest rates of <em>K. homeana</em> in three protected areas of Cameroon (Korup National Park, Banyang-Mbo Sanctuary, and Nta-Ali Reserve), estimated an overall mean annual harvest rate of 0.3 animals/km² in these areas with good habitat conditions and relatively low human density. Then, if 100% of the species’ range was protected and under relatively low human density, and extrapolating harvest data by Lawson (2000), the expected annual harvest rate would have been 236,532 tortoises, i.e., 5.6% of the total surviving tortoise population. However, the percent of protected territory is less than 3% of the species’ range, and the human population density is much higher in several regions of the species’ range than in the three protected areas of Cameroon studied by Lawson (2000), and hence we may conclude that the annual harvest rate is certainly much higher than the calculated 5.6%, but not quantifiable on the basis of current data. Also acknowledging the theoretical limits of our calculations, which are simply estimates, it is still very likely that the free-ranging populations of this species cannot sustain the current pressure (combination of continuing habitat loss and hunting) for more than 2–3 generations (<em>sensu</em> IUCN 2001), with each generation being about 15 years. Based on the above assumption, <em>K. homeana</em> meets at least the IUCN Red List criteria for Vulnerable status, but a case for an even higher category of risk can be made.",Decreasing,Afrotropical,Vulnerable,2006-01-31 00:00:00 UTC
Lepidochelys olivacea,"<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Habitats</span><br/>Like most other sea turtles, Olive Ridleys display a complex life cycle, which requires a range of geographically separated localities and multiple habitats (Márquez 1990). Females lay their nests on coastal sandy beaches from which neonates emerge and enter the marine environment to continue their development. They remain in a pelagic phase, drifting passively with major currents that disperse far from their natal sites, with juveniles sharing some of the adults’ habitats (Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000) until sexual maturity is reached (Musick and Limpus 1997). Reproductively active males and females migrate toward coastal zones and concentrate near nesting beaches. However, some males appear to remain in oceanic waters and mate with females en route to their nesting beaches (Plotkin <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1996, Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). Their post-breeding migrations are complex, with pathways varying annually (Plotkin 1994) and with no apparent migratory corridors, swimming hundreds or thousands of kilometers over large ocean expanses (Morreale <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007), commonly within the 20°C isotherms (Márquez 1990). In the East Pacific, they are present from 30°N to 15°S and often seen within 1,200 nautical miles from shore although they have been sighted as far as 140°W (IATTC 2004). Western Atlantic Olive Ridleys appear to remain in neritic waters after breeding (Pritchard 1976, Reichart 1993).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Demographic features / Reproduction</span><br/>The species displays three modes of reproduction: arribada, dispersed nesting, and mixed strategy (Bernardo and Plotkin 2007). The first mode represents a synchronous, mass nesting behaviour that may include hundreds to thousands of females over a period of days and occurs in fewer than a dozen places worldwide. The more common form of nesting is dispersed or “solitary” with no apparent synchronicity between individual events. At some localities, a mixture of these two forms of nesting can also occur. In general, individual Olive Ridleys may nest one, two or three times per season, with approximately 100–110 eggs per clutch (Pritchard and Plotkin 1995). For this assessment we have used an average number of 2.5 nests/female/season and 105 eggs/nest. In contrast to other sea turtle species, the reproductive cycle is nearly annual (over 60% of turtles nest every year; Márquez 1990). Solitary nesters oviposit on 14 day cycles whereas arribada nesters approximately every 28 days (Pritchard 1969, Kalb and Owens 1994, Kalb 1999). Kalb (1999) found that within a nesting season solitary nesters use multiple beaches for oviposition but arribada nesters display nest site fidelity. There are extreme variations in hatching rates between nesting beaches, however, in general they are much higher in solitary nesting beaches where around 80% is common and sometimes even higher (Gaos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). It is widely recognized that survivorship is extremely low on high-density arribada nesting beaches because of density-dependent mortality (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991) leading to hatching rates as low as 1 to 8% (Cornelius <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991). Moreover, turtles return approximately every month during a discrete nesting season (three to six months) and nests that remained intact during the previous month are again at risk when new waves of turtles crawl ashore. On solitary nesting beaches, where density-dependent mortality is not a factor, hatching rates are significantly higher (Castro 1986, Gaos <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Post-hatching survivorship is unknown and there is no information available on recruitment rates. Presumably, like other sea turtles, Olive Ridleys experience high mortality in their early life stages. Juveniles are believed to occur in similar habitats as the adults (i.e,. pelagic waters) where they forage on gelatinous prey such as jellyfish, salps and tunicates (Kopitsky <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004).","<p>For the purposes of Red List assessments, generation length is defined as the “average age of parents” (IUCN 2001). Since this information is not available from direct observation of sea turtle species we derived a comparable value from estimates of age at which 50% of the breeders are expected to have survived, using information for age at sexual maturity and adult survival rates. An important caveat is that, while it is known that different populations of the same species can attain sexual maturity at different ages (Heppell <em>et al.</em> 2003) and therefore different values would need to be taken into account for different regions, the information is only available for a single region and we have had to assume the estimated values are generally applicable on a global scale. The only published study on growth and age for Olive Ridleys (Zug <em>et al.</em> 2006) indicates a mean age at sexual maturity for North-central Pacific Ridley sea turtles of around 13 years (range of 10-18 years). We calculated the time it would take for a cohort of breeders to reach 50% of its original size from S<sup>n</sup> =50%, where <span times="""" new="""" roman="""">n is years since age at first reproduction, and S is annual survival. Solving for n, n = ln(0.5)/ln(S). As extensive estimates of annual survival rates for female nesters are only available from the better studied sister taxon, <em>Lepidochelys kempii</em>, (TEWG 2000) we used these, which have a range of 85-92% per year. Thus, n<sub>50% </sub>= 4-9 yrs and our derived average age of female Olive Ridley parents is 17-22 years. We additionally assumed that this value would be the same for male parents. For simplicity, we have used a value of 20 yrs for the species’ generation length in this assessment.</p>",Decreasing,Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,Vulnerable,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC

Tortoises feed on fallen fruits such as <em>Breonia perrieri</em> and <em>Aleanthus greveanus</em>. (Glaw and Vences 1994, Gibson and Buley 2004).

Testudo kleinmanni,"<em>T. kleinmanni</em> populations in northern Egypt are historically associated with desert and semi-desert habitats characterized or dominated by compact sand and gravel plains with scattered rocks and shallow sandy wadis, although populations were also known to occur in or adjacent to coastal salt marsh habitats (Lortet 1887, Baha El Din 1994). The majority of the species' primary habitats in Egypt are currently severely degraded, or already completely destroyed (Baha El Din 1994). 
<br/>
<br/>In Cyrenaica, northeastern Libya, the species occurs in shrubby sand and stone desert habitats (coast) and semidesert habitats with Artemisia association (further inland), according to Schleich (1987, 1989). Schleich <em>et al.</em> (1996) consider the species to occupy generally the margins of sandy, or dry stony, habitats. <em>T. kleinmanni</em> can apparently also be found (together with <em>Testudo graeca</em> species complex tortoises) in more vegetated Mediterranean subtropical shrub evergreen forests, as can be inferred from Schleich (1989) who cites Suluntah as a locality. It is however not clear how typical this habitat association is for <em>T. kleinmanni</em> in northeastern Libya, thus it is probably most appropriate to describe the species' primary habitat preference in Cyrenaica as Mediterranean scrub. Habitats are still in fairly good condition in Libya, but there are signs of extensive overgrazing in many parts, particularly in Cyrenaica, and ploughing for growing cereals is a common practice, and trends and plans for habitat utilization are unclear (S. Baha El Din 2002). According to fieldwork by A. Pieh (pers. comm.), in Cyrenaica habitat is locally still very good near Suluntah, and reasonably well preserved in the wadi system near Darnah. However, habitat on the whole coastal stretch between Darnah and Tubruq is severely degraded possibly due to extensive, and continuing, nomadic activity in that area. In Tripolitania habitat degradation due to human expansion is very evident on the coast east of Al Khums around Leptis Magna, whereas habitat in more southerly areas towards the inland near Gharyan ""looks better"" (A. Pieh, pers. comm.). Further, according to Pieh (pers. comm.), the coastline between Al Khums and the Tunisian border features occasional spots of undisturbed habitat.","Currently, the species is effectively extinct within Egypt. Baha El Din (1994) surveyed the whole former range of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> in Egypt and concluded that the species disappeared completely within a period of approximately 10 to 20 years (between the early 1970s and the early 1990s). This time frame is estimated to represent around, or slightly more than, one generation length for <em>T. kleinmanni</em>, taking into consideration that maturity is probably reached at about 10-20 years in the wild as is the case in several other species of testudinids living in semiarid or arid conditions (e.g., Woodbury and Hardy 1948, Brushko 1977, review in: Kuzmin 2002). In 2001, two wild tortoises were found in a protected coastal area in the Western Desert, the first record for <em>T. kleinmanni</em> in Egypt in over twenty years (M. Baha El Din 2002). This finding, although significant <em>per se</em>, does naturally nothing to change the fact that <em>T. kleinmanni</em> is effectively extinct in Egypt. 
<br/>
<br/>The species can still be found in  two distinct, and geographically disjunct regions in Libya (Tripolitania and Cyrenaica).
<br/>
<br/>Judging by data produced in Iverson (1992), Buskirk (1985) and Baha El Din (1994), the species' extent of occurrence in Egypt, possibly up to the early 1970s, is estimated as having been around 67,860 km². According to available data (Buskirk 1985, Iverson 1986, 1992, Fritz and Buskirk 1997, Perälä 2001, Pieh, pers. comm.), the small northwestern (Tripolitanian) range encompasses an estimated extent of occurrence of around 5,500 km². Nothing is known about local population densities but A. Pieh (pers. comm.) concluded <em>in situ</em> that the coastal subpopulation has to be severely fragmented because of a mosaic of badly degraded habitat. The estimated extent of occurrence for present Cyrenaican population of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> is around 11,100 km², as measured using a minimum convex polygon and locality data provided by S. Baha El Din (2002), and Pieh (pers. comm.). Some 40 years ago the Cyrenaican <em>T. kleinmanni</em> population had possibly an estimated extent of occurrence of 50,250 km² as calculated using data from Buskirk (1985), Iverson (1992), and Perälä (2001), as well as assuming that the distribution was continuous from Cyrenaica to western Egypt. The isolated locality of ""Sirtica"" (Loveridge and Williams 1957) some 300 km west of Qaminis (Gheminez) in western Cyrenaica was not taken into account.
<br/>
<br/>Because no fieldwork based data on the area of occupancy exist for <em>T. kleinmanni</em>, the area of occupancy is  defined as 10% of the area of extent of occurrence, yielding estimations of total past area of occupancy 12,361 km² and total present area of occupancy 1,660 km².
<br/>
<br/>20 years ago, Mendelssohn (1982) estimated  the global population size of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> (including <em>T. werneri</em> from Sinai and Israel) at less than 10,000 individuals, including immature tortoises. This figure seems to be an underestimation regarding current estimates and statistics on trade. Mendelssohn (1982) also was not aware of the existence of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> in northwestern Libya, which was therefore not taken into account in his assessment. Although no population density assessments based on local field data have been published for <em>T. kleinmanni</em> in mainland Egypt and Libya, densities are thought to be very low (Buskirk 1985, Schleich 1989, Baha El Din 1994, M. Baha El Din 2002, S. Baha El Din 2002, A. Pieh, pers. comm.). Locals in Libya stated in April 2002 that populations of the species still exist in many parts of Cyrenaica, but that they have declined notably in recent years due to collection (S. Baha El Din 2002). Perälä (2002) estimates the past total world population at 55,624 individuals, substantially more than the estimate by Mendelssohn (1982). The total present world  population of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> is estimated at 7,470 individuals (Perälä 2002), which  is considerably less than the number of recorded animals collected in Libya for the pet trade in the 1990s. Out of the existing global population around 75% (5,000 individuals) would be mature adults if Mendelssohn's (1982) data on population structure for <em>T. werneri</em> is applicable for <em>T. kleinmanni</em>. According to the above estimate, the global population of <em>T. kleinmanni</em> would have declined by 86.6% (or by 48,152 individuals) in less than three generations. Out of these, at least 10,680 individuals have been recorded from the illegal pet trade in the 1990s alone (Baha El Din 1994, Ventura 1995, Pieh, pers. comm.). Because relatively good habitat still exists in Libya it is possible that the earlier inferred reduction in the extent of occurrence  primarily reflects pressure from collection and illegal trade, rather than habitat degradation (in Libya).",Decreasing,Palearctic,Critically Endangered,2003-04-30 00:00:00 UTC
Testudo marginata,"It characteristically inhabits 'Phrygana' and Macchia scrub, dense thorny scrub among rocky outcrops, but also a range of other vegetation types, from coastal dunes to olive groves, small-scale agricultural landscapes and damp areas. It ranges up to 1300m, but mostly occurs below 800m. It generally prefers drier, hotter areas than the sympatric <em>T. hermanni boettgeri</em>. (Willemsen 1995b; Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001). Clutches consist of four to seven eggs, perhaps up to 15; females produce one to three clutches per year (review by Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001). Animals require about eight to 14 years to reach maturity (review by Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001). <em>Testudo m. weissinge</em>ri inhabits both Phrygana (Spartan shrubby rocky areas) as well as more lush habitats such as olive groves with dense herbaceous ground cover (Artner 2000;  Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001: 309-311). This taxon ranges from near sea level to about 1,300m altitude (Mueller1908, Bour 1996, in Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001: 311), and feeds on a variety of herbs (Bour 1996, in  Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001: 312). Its clutch size is a maximum of four, perhaps six eggs (Bour 1996, in  Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001: 314; Artner 2000).","It is generally considered to occur at low densities (Stubbs 1989c). Willemsen (1995b) and Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. (2001) note that the preferred habitat of the species is very hard to penetrate and survey, thus records of low-density occurrence might pertain to marginal habitats. A population in Sardinia that was perceived as intensively collected in the 1950s persists at 'normal' density (Stemmler, Fritz, in Bringsoe <em>et al</em>., 2001: 318). Populations of <em>T.m. weissingeri </em>are apparently dense, as Bour (1996) examined 384 animals and Artner (1996) encountered 30 animals in four hours, and 80 animals in two days. Bour (1996) recorded a male-dominated population structure, and very few juveniles (juveniles of <em>T. marginata</em> are very cryptic) (data summarised in  Bringsoe <em>et al</em>. 2001: 317). It is a very rare and localised species in Albania (Haxhiu, 2004).",Stable,Palearctic,Least Concern,2004-12-17 00:00:00 UTC

Chelonia mydas,"Like most sea turtles, green turtles are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (for review see Hirth 1997). Upon leaving the nesting beach, it has been hypothesized that hatchlings begin an oceanic phase (Carr 1987), perhaps floating passively in major current systems (gyres) that serve as open-ocean developmental grounds (Carr and Meylan 1980, Witham 1991). After a number of years in the oceanic zone, these turtles recruit to neritic developmental areas rich in seagrass and/or marine algae where they forage and grow until maturity (Musick and Limpus 1997). Upon attaining sexual maturity green turtles commence breeding migrations between foraging grounds and nesting areas that are undertaken every few years (Hirth 1997). Migrations are carried out by both males and females and may traverse oceanic zones, often spanning thousands of kilometers (Carr 1986, Mortimer and Portier 1989). During non-breeding periods adults reside at coastal neritic feeding areas that sometimes coincide with juvenile developmental habitats (e.g., Limpus <em>et al</em>. 1994, Seminoff <em>et al</em>. 2003).",,Decreasing,Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,Endangered,2004-04-30 00:00:00 UTC

Eretmochelys imbricata,"<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Habitats</span><br/>Hawksbills nest on insular and mainland sandy beaches throughout the tropics and subtropics. They are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (for review see Witzell 1983). Available data indicate that newly emerged hatchlings enter the sea and are carried by offshore currents into major gyre systems where they remain until reaching a carapace length of some 20 to 30 cm. At that point they recruit into a neritic developmental foraging habitat that may comprise coral reefs or other hard bottom habitats, sea grass, algal beds, or mangrove bays and creeks (Musick and Limpus 1997) or mud flats (R. von Brandis unpubl. data). As they increase in size, immature Hawksbills typically inhabit a series of developmental habitats, with some tendency for larger turtles to inhabit deeper sites (van Dam and Diez 1997, Bowen et al. 2007). Once sexually mature, they undertake breeding migrations between foraging grounds and breeding areas at intervals of several years (Witzell 1983, Dobbs <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999, Mortimer and Bresson 1999). Global population genetic studies have demonstrated the tendency of female sea turtles to return to breed at their natal rookery (Bowen and Karl 1997), even though as juveniles they may have foraged at developmental habitats located hundreds or thousands of kilometers from the natal beach. While Hawksbills undertake long migrations, some portion of immature animals may settle into foraging habitats near their beaches of origin (Bowen <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Roles in the Ecosystem&#160; </span><br/>Like other species of sea turtles, Hawksbills contribute to marine and coastal food webs and transport nutrients within the oceans (Bouchard and Bjorndal 2000). Hawksbills are important components of healthy coral reef ecosystems and are primarily spongivorous in the Caribbean (Meylan 1988), but more omnivorous in the Indo-Pacific (review by Bjorndal 1997). They consume relatively large amounts of algae in northern Australia (Whiting 2000 cited in S. Whiting in litt. to J. Mortimer 4 Jun 2007), soft corals in the Great Barrier Reef region (C. Limpus unpublished data), and other combinations of forage depending on habitat (in Seychelles, J. Mortimer and R. von Brandis unpublished data; in Barbados, B. Krueger unpublished data). At sites where they are primarily spongivorous, Hawksbills have been found to support healthy reefs by controlling sponges which would otherwise out-compete reef-building corals for space (Hill 1998, León and Bjorndal 2002, Bjorndal and Jackson 2003).","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Generation Length</span><br/>Generation length is defined as the age to maturity plus one half the reproductive longevity (Pianka 1974). Hawksbills mature very slowly, taking 20 to 40 years, and so are long-lived (Chaloupka and Musick 1997). In the Caribbean and Western Atlantic, Hawksbills may mature in 20 or more years (Boulon 1983, 1994; Diez and van Dam 2002; Krueger in litt. 2006). Age to maturity in the Indo-Pacific requires a minimum of 30-35 years (Limpus 1992; Limpus and Miller 2000; Mortimer <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, 2003). In northeastern Australia, first breeding is estimated to occur at 31-36 years for females and 38 years for males (Limpus and Miller 2000).<br/><br/>Data on reproductive longevity in Hawksbills are limited, but becoming available with increasing numbers of intensively monitored, long-term projects on protected beaches.&#160; During the last decade, numerous individual Caribbean Hawksbills have been recorded actively nesting over a period of 14-22 years (C.E. Diez in litt. 2006, Z. Hillis-Starr in litt. 2006, Parrish and Goodman 2006). In the Indo-Pacific&#160; Mortimer and Bresson (1999) and Limpus (1992) have reported nesting over 17-20 years, comparable to other Chelonid turtles which range from 20 to 30 years (Carr <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1978, FitzSimmons <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995).<br/><br/>Given estimated ages to maturity of 25 years in the Caribbean and 35 years in the Indo-Pacific, with half of reproductive longevity estimated at 10 years, a conservative generation length of 35 years (25 + 10 years) is calculated for the Caribbean and Western Atlantic, and 45 years (35 + 10 years) in the Indo-Pacific. In analyzing the data, declines over three generations are therefore measured for up to 105 years in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic and up to 135 years in the Indo-Pacific. In fact, generation length may well have been longer in the days when population density was higher (Bjorndal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000). <br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Nesting Population Size and Fecundity</span><br/>Sea turtle population trends are best diagnosed using in-water abundance estimates coupled with estimates of demographic parameters such as survival and recruitment possibilities (Chaloupka and Limpus 2001, Bjorndal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). However, these data rarely exist for sea turtle populations and so most assessments are based on evaluating nesting trends, which assumes a close correlation between population trends and nesting activity (Bjorndal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005).<br/>&#160;<br/>For this assessment the size of a nesting population is defined as the average number of individual females nesting per year. In some cases, population numbers can be determined by saturation tagging of nesting females or by recording the total number of slaughtered nesters. More often, however, population estimates need to be derived from records of the total number of egg clutches laid during a season. Saturation tagging of nesting females indicates that at most sites the average female Hawksbill lays between three and five egg clutches during a single nesting season (Richardson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999, Mortimer and Bresson 1999), with indications that newly recruited females lay fewer egg clutches (Mortimer and Bresson 1999, Beggs <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006), and possibly fewer clutches in the Arabian/Persian Gulf (Pilcher 1999). Following the pattern of earlier status reviews, the present assessment calculates the annual number of nesting females by dividing the total number of egg clutches recorded, by three to five to produce a bracketed population estimate.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Population Trends and Conclusions</span><br/>In many parts of the world, Hawksbill populations have continued to decline since the publication of the previous Red List Assessment (Meylan and Donnelly 1999). Continuing losses in southeast Asia are of particular concern. Hawksbills face multiple, severe threats. The volume of the tortoiseshell trade has diminished, yet it remains active and substantial, and the Japanese bekko industry remains intact.<br/><br/>In 2001 the IUCN Red List Standards and Petitions Subcommittee upheld the Critically Endangered listing of the Hawksbill, based on ongoing and long-term declines in excess of 80% within the time frame of three generations and ongoing exploitation (IUCN 2001b). The Subcommittee review cited “convincing evidence of reductions in excess of 80% over the last three generations at many, if not most of the important breeding sites throughout the global range of the species”. Not surprisingly, those declines reflect the intensity of the tortoiseshell trade in the 20th Century. Although some relatively large populations still exist, especially in Australia, this is not inconsistent with long-term global or even regional population reduction over three generations (a point noted by the Subcommittee). Unlike previous reviews of the status of the Hawksbill, the present assessment is quantitative and provides a numerical basis for the global listing of the species as Critically Endangered. The 2001 findings of the IUCN Red List Standards and Petitions Subcommittee are as valid today as they were six years ago.<br/><br/>The current assessment clearly demonstrates the importance of protection in both terrestrial and marine habitats. With protection, some populations have stabilized, and others are now increasing, most notably in the Caribbean. The increases documented in the Caribbean coincide with dramatic reductions in take on the foraging grounds of Cuba which have, in effect, spared tens of thousands of large Hawksbills since the early 1990s. Such increases provide hope for the future, but unfortunately are still the exception rather than the rule.

Astrochelys radiata,"The Radiated Tortoise is found in low irregular rainfall areas with xerophytic spiny vegetation dominated by Didiereaceae and <em>Ephorbia</em> (Durrell <em>et al</em>. 1989). They can be found on the high plateaus inland and also on the sandy dunes close to the coast (Leuteritz <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Radiated Tortoises are herbivores feeding predominantly on grasses and in some areas on the alien invasive <em>Opuntia</em>. On occasion they are also known to ingest animal matter. During the rainy season wild tortoises drink from water that collects on rocks after it rains (Leuteritz 2003).<br/><br/>Adult female tortoises range in carapace length from 24.2 - 35.6 cm and males ranged in from 28.5 - 39.5 cm (Pedrono 2008). Males exhibit distinct secondary sexual characteristics by about 26 cm carapace length (Leuteritz 2002). Mature females produce up to three clutches per season with 1–5 eggs per clutch (Leuteritz and Ravolanaivo 2005), leading to an estimated average production of two clutches of four eggs each per breeding female; an estimated 82% of mature females breed in an average year (Randriamahazo <em>et al</em>. 2007). No solid data exists on longevity but estimated life span is believed to be up to 100 years (Randriamahazo <em>et al</em>. 2007). A detailed overview of natural history is presented by Pedrono (2008).","Historically this species has been quite abundant, often being found along roadways and has served as symbol of Madagascar's south. This is not the case anymore. Tortoises are not found along major roadways but may be locally abundant in certain areas. According to O’Brien <em>et al</em>. (2003) the species is declining, with its range having contracted by one fifth over the last 25 years. Lewis (1995) reports density estimates based on line distance sampling of 262.2 to 1,076.7 tortoises/km², from which he extrapolated a conservative total population size of 1.6–4 million. Leuteritz <em>et al</em>. (2005) reported densities of 27–5,744 tortoises/km² with a total population estimate of 12 million. Rioux Paquette <em>et al</em>. (2006) undertook a microsatellite genetic analysis, which identified three distinct conservation units with relatively high assignments rates. The study supported the role of the Menarandra and Manambovo Rivers as major barriers to the dispersal for most Radiated Tortoises.<br/><br/>Population models were calculated at the 2005 Population and Habitat Viability Analysis (PHVA) workshop based on a number of variables including estimated population size and annual harvest intensity. Depending on the variables selected, the species was predicted to reach extinction at various times, with most estimates clustering around 45 years into the future (range 20-100+ years) (Randriamahazo <em>et al</em>. 2007).",Decreasing,Afrotropical,Critically Endangered,2008-01-15 00:00:00 UTC
Astrochelys yniphora,"The species is found in the Baly Bay region (over an area of approximately 700 km², though only 66 km² of this is considered suitable habitat). This region is comprised of dry deciduous forest, savanna, and mangrove swamps. The climate is tropical with a distinctly seasonal rainfall patterns. Angonoka utilize bamboo-scrub habitat, which is considered to be a secondary stage of the dry deciduous forest (Curl <em>et al</em>. 1986). Bamboo-scrub habitat consists of a mosaic of shrubs, bamboo, savanna grasses, and open, non vegetated areas. The shrubs are generally under 2 m and the dominant species include <em>Bauhinia</em> sp. and <em>Terminalia</em> sp. Bamboo (<em>Perrierbambos madagascariensis</em>) occurs in dense thickets within the habitat. Andrianandrasana (2000) estimates there are 7,975 ha of suitable habitat of which 6,669 ha have tortoises occupying them. Elevation is less than 50 m above sea level (Smith <em>et al</em>. 1999a and b).<br/><br/>Adult male tortoises are larger and heavier than females. Mean adult male length and weight is 414.8 mm (range 361-486 mm) and 10.3 kg (range 7.2-18.9 kg) respectively. Mean adult female length and weight is 370.1 mm (range 307-426 mm) and 8.8 kg (range 5.5-12 kg) respectively (Pedrono and Markwell 2001).<br/><br/>According to Smith (1999) grasses and forbs in open rocky areas of bamboo scrub habitat appeared to be important food items. Feeding was observed from October through May. Tortoises were observed to feed upon herbs, forbs and shrubs (<em>Bauhinia</em> sp. and <em>Terminalia</em> sp.) rather than grasses. Tortoises were never observed feeding on live bamboo, however, on several occasions they consumed leaf litter that included dead bamboo leaves. Angonoka were also observed feeding on dried carnivore and African bush pig feces (Smith 1999).<br/><br/>Smith (1999) estimates sexual maturity at a minimum of 15 years old. A study by Pedrono <em>et al</em>. (2001) showed the reproductive period was from 15 January to 30 May and tortoises produced 1-6 eggs (mean 3.2) per clutch and up 4 (mean 2.45) clutches per season. Despite low densities the egg fertility rate was 71.9% and resulting hatching success was 54.6% (Pedrono <em>et al</em>. 2001). This yields an estimated annual production of 3.2x2.45x54.6% = 4.3 hatchlings per reproducing female. By analogy with <em>Astrochelys radiata</em>, the average age of reproducing animals per generation time is estimated as being 42 years (Madagascar WS 2008).","It was estimated that the total wild population is about 600 individuals (440 to 770). These are found within five subpopulations: two to the east of the Andranomavo river (Sada and Beheta) and three to the west of the river (Ambatomainty, Betainalika, Andrafiafaly) (Smith <em>et al</em>. 1999, Pedrono 2000). Based on distance sampling surveys and the extent of suitable habitat (by 2005), DWCT estimated a maximum of 800 wild animals. Recent impacts (illegal collection for the international pet trade) have reduced the estimated population substantially, and the wild population is currently estimated to possibly be as low as 400 individuals, of which 200 adults (G. Pedrono pers.comm., 2008).<br/><br/>Based on the Population Viability Analysis performed for this species (Pedrono <em>et al</em>. 2004), and recent level of poaching for international trade, the Angonoka is at extreme risk of extinction in the wild within 10 to 15 years, less than one generation time of 42 years.",Decreasing,Afrotropical,Critically Endangered,2008-01-15 00:00:00 UTC

Females have a recorded maximum carapace length of 35.3 cm and males have been recorded reaching 27.4 cm in carapace length (Georges <em>et al</em>. 2006). Females have been found to average 1.31 kg in body mass, males average 0.92 kg (Lyons <em>et al</em>. 2013). The species is apparently primarily piscivorous (Rhodin and Mittermeier 1976) but in captivity will consume worms and other live food and meat products. Reproduction in captivity has been recorded as producing two clutches ca. three months apart of 8 to 11 eggs per clutch, with eggs measuring 29 x 26 mm each on average and incubating for ca. 90 days at 27–33 ºC, and hatchlings averaging 35 mm in carapace length and weighing <em>ca</em>&#160;6 g each (Fritz and Jauch 1989).","<em>Chelodina parkeri</em> is relatively abundant throughout the extensive permanent and semi-permanent inland lowland swamps of the Merauke, Fly and Bamu-Aramia Rivers, and likely to be equally abundant in similar habitat throughout its range.

Dermochelys coriacea,"<p><em>D. coriacea</em> is an oceanic, deep-diving marine turtle inhabiting tropical, subtropical, and subpolar seas. Leatherbacks make extensive migrations between different feeding areas at different seasons, and to and from nesting areas. Leatherbacks feed predominantly on jellyfishes, salps and siphonophores. Females usually produce several (3-10) clutches of 60-90 eggs in a reproductive season, and typically have a re-migration interval of multiple years (2+) between subsequent reproductive seasons. For a thorough review of Leatherback biology, please see Eckert <em>et al</em>. (2012).</p>  <p><br/></p>","<p>Leatherbacks are a single species globally comprising seven biologically described regional management units (RMUs; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010), which describe biologically and geographically explicit population segments by integrating information from nesting sites, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA studies, movements and habitat use by all life stages. RMUs are functionally equivalent to IUCN subpopulations, thus providing the appropriate demographic unit for Red List assessments. There are seven Leatherback RMUs (hereafter subpopulations): Northwest Atlantic Ocean, Southeast Atlantic Ocean, Southwest Atlantic Ocean, Northeast Indian Ocean, Southwest Indian Ocean, East Pacific Ocean, and West Pacific Ocean (Figure 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Multiple genetic stocks have been defined according to geographically disparate nesting areas around the world (Dutton<em> et al</em>. 1999, 2013), and are included within RMU delineations (Wallace<em> et al</em>. 2010; shapefiles can be viewed and downloaded at: <a href=""http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot"">http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot</a>).</p>",Decreasing,Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,Vulnerable,2013-06-21 00:00:00 UTC
Pyxis arachnoides,"The Spider Tortoise is found in Mikea forest habitat in the north and in communities of xerophytic spiny vegetation with low irregular rainfall dominated by Didiereaceae and <em>Ephorbia</em> in the south (Durrell <em>et al</em>. 1989, Walker <em>et al</em>. 2007). Their habitat consists of sandy areas with spiny vegetation close to the coast. They do not tend to utilize rocky areas like <em>A. radiata</em> does (T. Leuteritz pers. obs.). Acccording to Walker <em>et al</em>. (2008) <em>P. a. arachnoides</em> was only recorded as feeding during the wet months, a period of increased activity. Tortoises are known to eat young leaves and cow dung with insect larva (Glaw and Vences 1994).

Reproductive age is thought to be at about 12 years (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2004), and average reproductive age (=generation time) was conservatively estimated at 20 years at the 2008 Red List workshop. No solid data exists on longevity but estimated life span is believed to be up to 70 yrs (Randriamahazo <em>et al</em>. 2007).","The earliest information on populations comes from Bour (1981), who anecdotally stated that <em>P. arachnoides</em> was localized but not rare. Raxworthy and Nussbaum (2000) estimate that there were more than ten populations and that the area of distribution could cover more than 2,000 km². Jesu and Schimmenti (1995) who undertook the first quantitative estimate of population density reported approximately three individuals per ha. Walker <em>et al</em>. (2008) report densities of 4.63 and 2.08 tortoises per ha in the wet and dry seasons respectively. Both these studies were on <em>P. a. arachnoides</em>.

Chelonoidis abingdonii,"<em>Chelonoidis abingdonii</em> was a saddlebacked tortoise adapted for browsing on higher vegetation,&#160;in particular, low-hanging cactus pads. Pinta habitat, before its destruction by feral goats, was largely dry xeric brushland and grassland at lower elevations, with limited more mesic forest habitat at higher elevations.&#160;<em>Opuntia</em>&#160;cactus trees are dominant in much of the Arid and Transition Zones on the island and provide an important food resource for tortoises. Habitats are now recovering following goat eradication.","Based on an estimated average density of one tortoise per hectare of suitable habitat, the pre-impact population was estimated to have been about 2,500 adults (Gibbs, unpubl. data). The Pinta Giant Tortoise was heavily exploited and its population collapsed in the middle of the <a>19<sup>th </sup></a>century,&#160;followed by significant collecting in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries and exploitation by local fishermen subsequently.

Chelonoidis hoodensis,"<em>Chelonoidis hoodensis&#160;</em>is a saddlebacked tortoise adapted for browsing on cacti and other higher-growing vegetation in drier shrubland ecosystems.&#160;Based on first successful <em>in situ </em>reproduction, in 1990, of reintroduced animals born in captivity as early as&#160;1971,&#160;age at first reproduction is approximately&#160;20 years, and generation time is estimated at 60 years.","<p>                    </p><p>Based on an estimated average density of one tortoise per hectare of suitable habitat, the pre-human population size was estimated to have been about 2,400 adults (J.P. Gibbs unpubl. data). By the 1960s, the total global population was known to be 15 mature adult animals, 12 females and three males (one was located at the San Diego Zoo and returned to Galápagos in 1977). An intensive conservation breeding and re-introduction program has subsequently increased the population: nearly <a>1,900 </a>have been repatriated and of those approximately 50% survive (Gibbs <em>et al</em>. 2014). &#160;A total of&#160;1,837&#160;animals have been reintroduced to Española since 1975; reproduction by the reintroduced animals was first observed on the island in 1990 (Márquez <em>et al</em>. 1991). Most recent survey data (2010) estimate about 700 animals at Tunas/Caco in the central part of the island, and an additional 100 animals inland of Gardner Bay, about 800 in total. Given that about half of all repatriated animals survive, many have now reached reproductive age. Estimates for the current population vary from 11-20%comprised of &#160;<em>in situ</em> recruitment, thus repatriated animals make up 80-89% of the&#160;<em>in situ</em>&#160;population.&#160;The success of this program is also demonstrated by genetic&#160;analyses which indicate that while none of the tortoises sampled in 1994 had hatched on the island, of those tested in 2004 and 2007, 3%&#160;and 24% were&#160;<em>in situ </em>hatchlings , respectively (Milinkovitch <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;The recovery of this population despite its extremely low effective population size is probably due to Española tortoises having been subjected to population bottlenecks at different points in time prior to the arrival of humans in the Archipelago, rather than a single drastic reduction in recent times (Garrick <em>et&#160;al</em>. 2012). These declines may have been related to environmental fluctuations, which may have led to purging of deleterious recessive alleles improving the long-term survival prospects of the repatriated population (Milinkovitch <em>et al</em>. 2013).

Chelonoidis porteri,"<em>Chelonoidis porteri</em>&#160;is a large tortoise with a dome-shaped carapace; it feeds predominantly on low-growing vegetation. As occurs in other Galápagos tortoise taxa, first reproduction likely occurs after 20 years of age, and a generation time of 60 years is estimated.&#160;Higher elevation areas are dominated by males and some females, middle elevation areas by males, females and some juveniles, and lower elevation areas by females and juveniles. Adult tortoises migrate up and down the elevation gradient, with movements timed to short, rainfall-driven bursts in lowland plant productivity. Nests occur between 6-149 m above sea level, in the hottest, driest and least productive part of the tortoise range. Nest temperature and egg survival declines with increasing elevation whereas hatchling survival and growth are highest at intermediate elevations. Hatchlings disperse between 100-600 m from their nests before becoming sedentary in ranges typically &lt;0.04 ha (Blake <em>et al</em>. 2012, unpubl. data).","<p>                 </p><p>Based on an estimated average density of one tortoise per hectare of suitable habitat, the pre-human population size of the population of&#160;<em>Chelonoidis porteri</em>&#160;was estimated as 35,000 adult animals (J.P.

Cyclanorbis senegalensis,"Based on available literature, <em>Cyclanorbis senegalensis</em> appears to utilize nearly any freshwater body in its range, but with a strong emphasis on small, seasonal ponds, puddles and marshes with high productivity and amphibian aggregations (overview by Gramentz 2008). In northern Ghana (Mole National Park), the species occurs along the Nyanga River (F. Petrozzi and M. Di Vittorio, unpubl. data), and in central Nigeria (Lokoja) both along the Niger and the Benue Rivers (Luiselli and Akani, unpubl. data). In Ivory Coast (Comoé National Park) and Bénin (Pendjari National Park) adults inhabit predominantly large permanent ponds as well as deeper, relatively calm parts in riverine forests within the savanna zone (but in shaded waters where they can be observed basking); whereas hatchlings and juveniles may be found far from these habitats in temporary savannah waters (Rödel and Grabow 1995). Both adults and hatchlings have been observed to migrate larger distances across land (Rödel and Grabow 1995; M.-O. Rödel and J. Penner, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>The diet of <em>C. senegalensis</em> is not well known, but amphibians, particularly tadpoles, and fish, are known to be a significant food source, while larger animals appear morphologically adapted for feeding on freshwater clams and snails (Gramentz 2008). <em>Cyclanorbis senegalensis</em> rarely exceeds 35 cm straight carapace length (SCL), at which size it weighs just under 5 kg (Gramentz 2008), but Trape <em>et al</em>. (2012) stated it could reach 60 cm in SCL. Size and age at maturity and longevity appear unrecorded; by analogy with other medium-sized Trionychid species inhabiting seasonal waterbodies, a generation time of 15 years is estimated. Clutch sizes of 6 to 25 eggs have been indicated in the literature. Hatchlings measure less than 45 mm SCL (review by Gramentz 2008).","<p>Anecdotal information suggests that the species can be abundant in suitable locations, although given the seasonal dynamics of its preferred pond habitat, such observations may be based on occasional aggregations and concentrations of animals from wide areas (overview by Gramentz 2008). It is suspected to have disappeared from many localities within its wide range. In Nigeria, the species is mostly uncommon (although still widespread in the southwest) and with apparently fragmented populations; it occurs with relatively abundant populations only in a few water bodies inside well-preserved Guinea savannah areas (Akani, Luiselli, Eniang, unpubl. data). In Togo, it is not common and is found only in the northern Sudanese savannah region, with a few populations recorded from Kundja Konkomba, Mango, Kara, and Mandouri, and interviews with local people suggests that it should be present also in the Djambé Nature Reserve. Population sizes are declining in Togo (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2014). There has been a range contraction in Senegal; historically in the north, and continuing in the Senegal river.

Recently, this species was found in Sokodé area, and another specimen reportedly originating from Togo was observed at a reptile farm located in Lomé (Segniagbeto <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>In Nigeria, the species is rare, and inhabits only brackish water rivers with mangroves along the banks (Rivers and Bayelsa States; Stubbs Creek Reserve in Akwa-Ibom State), and enters freshwater tracts along the Cross River. It has also been recorded in Cross River National Park (E. Eniang and L. Luiselli unpubl. data).&#160;In Nigeria, it generally occurs at the wide mouth of big rivers and in wide lakes, lagoons and waterbodies.<br/><br/>In Gabon <em>Trionyx triunguis</em> is considered quite common. It is known from Akanda, Ivindo, Loango, Mayumba,  Minkebe, and Moukalaba national parks (Vande weghe <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In Angola and Namibia, the southern limit of the species is reached in the mouth of the Cunene River, between Namibia and Angola. &#160;It was first recorded from Namibia by Penrith (1971); Griffin (2003) noted that the&#160;species nests at Foz du Cunene, perhaps accounting for reports of Green Turtles (<em>Chelonia mydas</em>) nesting there (Hughes <em>et al</em>. 1973). A single specimen is known from Olushandja dam, but this animal was possibly imported from Angola (C. Eyre pers. comm.). <em>Trionyx</em> is common at the Cunene River mouth and is frequently hooked by fisheries biologists. Animals are occasionally seen in the adjacent sea, but their occurrence and distribution upstream and along the coast is unknown. Besides the Olushandja specimen, only two other Namibian specimens exist (Penrith 1971), and a specimen in the Möwe Bay Museum from Torra Bay. This species also occurs in the Skeleton Coast Park.<br/><br/>Few recent records for Angola include specimens from “the mouth of the river Cunene and its surroundings, in the Cuio region near the mouth of the Coporolo River, on the river Cuanza where I saw nests about 100 km upstream of the mouth, and in the bay of Luanda where a few dozen animals feed. Additionally I have a record of a dead male in the Palmeirinhas region” (Michel Morais, in litt. to WR Branch).&#160; Another large dead adult was recorded on the beach at Soyo, on the southern bank of the Congo River Mouth (W. Klein in litt. to W.R. Branch).<br/><br/>On balance, while the populations and trends in the Mediterranean are relatively well known and offer cause for concern, populations in West Africa and as far south as Angola are poorly known. Large rivers and suitable habitat are few (rapids on the Congo River preclude occupation of the Congo Basin) and populations in the rivers of West Africa are all subject to human population growth and habitat degradation. There is no justification for considering that the remnant West African populations meaningfully protect the species globally.</p>",Decreasing,Afrotropical|Palearctic,Vulnerable,2016-06-21 00:00:00 UTC

Kinosternon alamosae,"<em>K. alamosae</em> is known only from seasonal aquatic habitats such as wet season pools and reservoirs for cattle, and has not been found in permanent waterbodies (Berry and Legler 1980, Iverson 1989). It is thought to be active only or mainly in the wet season (July-September) (Berry and Legler 1980, Iverson 1989). Animals can occur in extreme conditions, such as ponds with only 10 cm water depth and water temperature up to 42ºC (Iverson 1989). <em>K. alamosae</em> might be microsympatric with <em>K. integrum</em> when the latter moves from its usual permanent waterbody habitats into seasonal pools during the wet season (Berry and Legler 1980, Iverson 1989).
<br/>
<br/><em>K. alamosae</em> is primarily carnivorous, while considerable plant material is also ingested (Iverson 1989).
<br/> 
<br/>Males are 9.0 to 13.5 cm carapace length, females 8.9 to 12.6 cm (Berry and Legler 1980). Females mature at about 10 cm carapace length and 5 to 7 years of age (Iverson 1989). Berry and Legler (1980) and Iverson (1989) hypothesized that at least some females lay more than one clutch per nesting season (July-August, late rainy season).

Kinosternon arizonense,"<em>K. arizonense</em> resides in temporary preseas, ponds, tanks and roadside ditches, as well as in some permanent lentic waters. Arizona Mud Turtles seem to avoid permanent streams and rivers (Iverson 1989).
<br/>
<br/>An activity period during the rains from early July to middle August was reported for the Sonora desert (Iverson 1989); in adverse years, aestivation grades into hibernation without an activity period at all (Schilde 2001). The animals are active mainly during daylight hours, basking when air temperatures approach 45ºC, and can undertake substantial travels on the desert floor (Iverson 1989). 
<br/>The species is primarily a carnivorous feeder.
<br/>
<br/>Females appear to reach maturity at a body size of 12 to 13 cm and 6 to 10 years of age (Iverson 1989). Mating occurs in July, and nesting occurs in July and early August; clutches comprise on average 4.7 eggs (range 1 to 9), and females typically lay two or three clutches. Hatching probably takes place in the next year's rainy season, with an incubation period of about 11 months (Iverson 1989).","It can occur locally at very high densities: 45 minutes of trapping in one 0.15 ha pond gathered 25 adult animals (translating to a biomass of 58 kg/ha), and additional trapping would probably have caught more turtles (Iverson 1989). It is locally extremely common, particularly between 200 and 800 m altitude, and human construction of ponds is considered to benefit populations of <em>K. arizonense</em> (Iverson 1989, and in litt. 28 Jan 2007).",Stable,Nearctic|Neotropical,Least Concern,2007-03-01 00:00:00 UTC

Kinosternon chimalhuaca,"Inhabits primarily ponds and pools, with clear or muddy water, with or without submerged and riparian vegetation, including pools in intermittent streams and possible spring-fed pools, but apparently avoiding flowing rivers (Berry <em>et al</em>. 1997). The geographic area inhabited by <em>K. chimalhuaca</em> is adjacent but separate from the area inhabited by <em>K. integrum</em>, and the species is broadly sympatric only with two <em>Rhinoclemmys</em> species.
<br/>
<br/>The species was suggested to be a primarily carnivorous, opportunistic feeder; molluscs, insects and crustaceans, as well as substantial quantities of decaying plant material and inorganic detritus, have been recorded in the diet (Berry <em>et al</em>. 1997). 
<br/>
<br/>Captive observations indicate that the species aestivates (Schilde 2001). 
<br/>
<br/>Females reach maturity at a CL between 99 and 107 mm, at an estimated age of 7 to 10 years. Males probably reach sexual maturity at CL of about 100 mm and an age of 5 to 7 years. (Berry <em>et al</em>. 1997). 
<br/>
<br/>Females probably produce a single clutch, possibly two clutches, in July or August; three clutches laid in captivity [presumably by recently-collected females] comprised 2, 4 and 5 eggs (Berry <em>et al</em>. 1997). Long-term captive animals produce 3 to 4 clutches of up to five eggs from August to January (Schilde 2001).","Within suitable habitat, the species is apparently fairly abundant, at least seasonally: trapping in a 4,000 sq. m pond captured 81 individuals in 10 hours, trapping in a 1,200 sq. m pond gathered 26 animals, and a single pool in an intermittent stream course yielded 31 animals caught overnight with five baited traps (Berry <em>et al&lt;</i>. 1997).

Kinosternon creaseri,"The species is restricted to the mesic parts of the rather arid northern Yucatan Peninsula, where no surface streams exist and the aquatic habitat is restricted to cenotes (pools in limestone sinkholes) and temporary pools (Duellman 1965 in Smith and Smith 1979, Iverson in Groombridge 1982, Buskirk 1997). Artner (2004) found animals in surface rainpools but not in cenotes, at water depths of 5 to 30 cm (exceptionally 80 cm); they shared these waters with <em>Rhinoclemmys areolata</em> and <em>Kinosternon scorpioides cruentatum</em>. The distribution of <em>K. creaseri</em> is complementary to that of <em>K. acutum</em> and <em>K. leucostomum</em> and broadly sympatric with <em>K. scorpioides cruentatum</em>.
<br/>
<br/>Artner (2004) thought the natural diet to consist of aquatic insects and their larvae, fallen insects and freshwater snails, which has been confirmed by faecal data. It is tolerant of moderate habitat disturbance, although very intensive habitat modification, not found within its range at present, would be a problem.

Dermatemys mawii,"<em>Dermatemys</em> primarily inhabit the larger deeper rivers and oxbow lakes throughout the year. During the rainy season they will enter the flooded forests and travel up smaller river courses to nest. Often as flood waters recede they will become trapped in oxbow lakes until the next rainy season, since they are so poorly designed for terrestrial locomotion. Even though this turtle is a fast swimmer and is capable of swimming up rapids they often concentrate in the deep pools at the bottom of the river during the day (Vogt unpublished data). Well oxygenated water is preferred, as they have highly vascularized papillae in the larynx which enable them to stay underwater indefinitely, drawing water in through the mouth and exhaling through the nostrils. However anaerobic black water oxbow lakes used to hold large concentrations of <em>Dermatemys</em> that are trapped there after the water level of the river recedes in the dry season. Although <em>Dermatemys</em> will use fast-moving sections of rivers, they often seek respite from the current in the calmer parts of deep pools and are found in association with submerged tree trunks imbedded in the river bottom. Larger turtles usually rest on the bottom and sometimes partially imbed themselves if the substrate is soft enough. Small individuals often seek shelter closer to shore, resting partially imbedded in accumulations of detritus and also hidden amongst the branches of submerged trees. During April and May, the dry season, adult <em>Dermatemys</em> congregate in the deeper waterholes, 6 m or more in depth. During this same time of the year juveniles and subadults can be found along the shorelines of smaller tributaries taking refuge within the branches of fallen trees or mounds of accumulated detritus (Alvarez del Toro <em>et al</em>. 1979, Polisar 1996, Vogt pers. obs.). Populations in Belize are known to enter estuaries (Moll 1989). Dermatemys is an herbivorous turtle throughout its life (Alvarez del Toro <em>et al</em>. 1979, Moll 1989, Vogt unpublished data). It eats a wide variety of aquatic vegetation, fallen leaves and leaf detritus, and fallen fruits from riparian vegetation. Belizean populations are also known to enter estuaries to feed upon mangrove vegetation and sea grasses (Moll 1989). <br/> <br/>Females reach maturity between 34.2–42.0 cm, while males become mature between 32.8-38.5 cm (Polisar 1996, Vogt unpublished data). Females grow larger than males; largest size reported is 60 cm and 22 kg (Alvarez del Toro <em>et al</em>. 1979), although none of 567 turtles examined by Polisar (1996) in North-Central Belize during 1989–1990 exceeded 49 cm. No information is available on age at maturity or on longevity. <br/> <br/>Nesting begins during the height of the rainy season from September through December when water levels are at their annual peaks; up to three, exceptionally four, clutches of eggs are laid (Vogt and Flores-Vilela 1992, Polisar 1996). Reports in the literature describing the nesting season as March and April (Lee 1969, Moll 1986a) were based on turtles found in the markets that were most likely holding their eggs for an extended period due to their captive condition. Some females may lay their ultimate clutch for the season in late February or early March, but these are anomalies. Vitellogenesis begins in June and July with oviposition from September to March in the Rio Lacantun in Chiapas (Vogt unpublished data). <br/> <br/>Nests are excavated within 3 m of the shoreline, usually within 1 m (Alvarez del Toro <em>et al</em>. 1979), often in saturated soil. Nests are often constructed under an overhanging river bank. Since the nests are scattered along a dynamic shoreline during the rainy season they often go undetected by predators. Often nests are exposed by flood waters creating the misconception that this species of turtle lays its eggs underwater (Vogt unpublished data). The earliest nests of the season are often inundated for weeks at a time with no effect on survivorship. Polisar (1992) documented 80–100% hatching success in eggs subjected to more than 30 days of submersion in water. The physiological mechanisms of this emybryonic diapause need to be investigated further. <br/> <br/>Up to three clutches were laid per year in Chiapas, with clutch size ranging from 6-16 eggs. Incubation time in the laboratory varied from 115–223 days, this variation is attributed to embryonic dormancy. Diapause allows the eggs to remain at an early developmental stage when environmental conditions are not favorable for development, cool temperatures and flood conditions, diapause is broken by drying of the nests and warmer temperatures. Clutches laid over a 4 month time span hatch synchronously, stimulated by moistening of the soil during the first summer rains (Vogt unpublished data). In Belize Polisar (1992) reported 217–300 days between oviposition and hatchling emergence. Vogt and Flores-Villela (1992) reported that incubation temperatures in the laboratory above 28° C produced all females and temperatures of 25–26° C produced males.","In the 1970s populations in Tabasco near Villahermosa were decimated and the professional turtle hunters began to go farther and farther away to find turtles to harvest. Harvest quantities in the 1970s amounted to 1,000–2,000 turtles per lake annually; the species was abundant enough in the Tio Lacantum area, Chiapas, that traders built an airstrip to fly them out to Villahermosa (Alvarez del Toro <em>et al</em>. 1979). Tales were told by locals of 100s to a thousand <em>Dermatemys</em> taken in a single day in oxbow lakes along the Rio Lacantun and Lago Palestina near Juarez, Chiapas (Vogt unpublished data). By the 1980s no such large populations remained, and the largest confiscations were rarely over 100 turtles. By 1990 Vogt (pers. obs.) never saw more than 5 animals in one place being held from confiscation or for sale. In the Rio Tsendales, Selva Lacandona, Chiapas, in the 1980s, it was possible to catch 40–45 adults in 5 days of trapping with 20 fyke nets (Vogt unpubished data). By the mid 1990s this population had been decimated by Tabascanian turtle trappers, even though the area was completely within the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve (Vogt pers. obs.). <br/> <br/>Populations of <em>Dermatemys</em> are now so low in Mexico that recovery is perhaps not possible in most regions. The only viable populations of <em>Dermatemys</em> currently (in 2005) exist in inaccessible areas far from civilization. In the Rio Blanco of Veracruz there exists a recuperating population, with a proportion of subadults to adults that is extremely high. Normally at least 80 per cent of the population consists of adults when the population is not being over harvested (Vogt unpublished data). When there are few adults and few subadults and more hatchlings found than adults the population is in extremely fragile shape. When this population was trapped in the late 1990s it had a majority (80%) of subadults, signifying that the adults had recently been overharvested, but that there was sufficient reproductive stock being produced that the population was judged to be recuperating. How many decades this might take is unknown (Vogt unpublished data). <br/> <br/><em>Dermatemys</em> is legally protected by several laws and international agreements but these regulations have not stopped its capture or consumption, and populations of the species in Mexico have been almost eliminated (Vogt and Flores Villela 1992). In Guatemala the status of the population is not clear (Polisar and Horwich 1994). Moll (1986b) conducted countrywide surveys of river systems inhabited by <em>Dermatemys</em>, and market surveys, in 1983–1984. Polisar (1992) documented population structures in sections of the Belize River exposed to contrasting levels of exploitation, finding adults very scarce in the heavily exploited sections. There are reasonable probabilities that some populations in Belize are now afforded at least partial protection, such as sections of Rio Bravo and Irish Creek, Cox Lagoon, and part of the Sibun River (which is a village-originated Hickatee Conservation Area). While pressures in Belize can be assumed to be high, trends have been less disastrous and declines less rapid than in Mexico. <br/> <br/>In Guatemala the status of the populations are not known (Polisar and Horwich 1994). A herpetofauna survey of Laguna del Tigre, Peten, Guatemala, in April 1999 focused on Morelet's Crocodile but also recorded the occurrence of <em>Dermatemys</em>, though in densities too low to quantify reliably (Castañeda Moya <em>et al</em>. 2000). Further surveys in Guatemala and follow-up evaluations in Belize are a priority. <br/> <br/>It was listed in the 1982 IUCN Amphibia-Reptilia Red Data Book as Vulnerable (Groombridge 1982) and has been considered as a high priority by the IUCN Tortoise &amp; Freshwater Turtle SG in its 1989 action plan; it was uplisted to Endangered in the 1996 IUCN Red List.",Decreasing,Neotropical,Critically Endangered,2006-01-31 00:00:00 UTC

In contrast to its vernacular name, the Bog Turtle generally avoids strongly acidic bogs (pH &lt;5.5). As Ernst and Lovich (2009) noted, these are often ecologically ephemeral habitats due to vegetation succession. Bog Turtles have small home ranges, at the order of fractions of a hectare, but moderate-distance movements have been reported travelling both overland and using small streams (Carter <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000, Pittmann <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009).   <p>Bog Turtles are opportunistic omnivores, feeding on a great variety of invertebrate and small vertebrate animal prey as well as seeds, fruits and occasionally other parts of a range of herbs, grasses, sedges and shrubs (see review by Ernst and Lovich 2009). </p>  <p>Bog Turtles can reach up to 11.5 cm carapace length (CL) in males, and 9.6 cm CL in females. Size and age at maturity has been reported as about 7–8 cm CL and 4–6 years in males, and half a cm larger and likely a year later in females. Females normally produce a single clutch of 3–4 (range 1–6) eggs; not all females reproduce in any given year. Hatchlings measure on average 26–28 mm CL. Longevity may exceed 30 years; generation time has not been calculated (see review by Ernst and Lovich 2009). </p>","Population densities for Bog Turtle occurrences have been reported ranging from one to 213 turtles per hectare. Given the small size of most sites inhabited by bog turtles (average of about one hectare in the south, <span style=""background-color: yellow;""></span>variable size in the northern population), individual sites rarely comprise more than 40 adult individuals (Chase 1989, Mitchell 1991).

Terrapene coahuila,"The Cuatro Cienegas basin is an hourglass-shaped intermontane basin of about 50 km long and 8 to 24 km wide (about 600 sq. km), its floor being at 720 m altitude. Much of the central part of the basin is marshy (maximum 60 cm water depth), with dry sandy slopes leading up the rocky valley slopes. Many of the marshes and ponds are spring-fed. A number of deep (up to several metres) ponds occur within the marshy area, and retain crystal-clear water throughout the year. About half the bottom is covered by dense submerged aquatic vegetation (mainly <em>Chara</em>), the other half is bare sediment. Waterlilies grow in the shallow parts, and thick stands of cattails (<em>Typha</em>) and <em>Eleocharis</em> fringe the ponds. Water temp is about 27 to 29°C. Ponds may be separated from dry nesting areas on the slopes by substantial distances (several 100 m) of flat marshy grassland. (Webb and Legler 1960).

The general habitat comprises low-lying, undulating plains (seldom rocky terrain, but never koppies), with a dominant low to medium-high shrub layer, a strong restioid and ericoid presence, and an essentially annual, herbaceous understorey with perennial grasses (Baard 1995a). During&#160;the hot and dry season&#160;<em>P. geometricus</em> takes refuge in slightly damper microhabitats under dense vegetation (E. Baard pers. obs.).

Females outnumber males, at male/female ratios of 0.43 to 0.83 in different populations. Wild females produce one or two annual clutches (average 1.3) each averaging 5.4 eggs (McCoy <em>et al</em>. 2014); infertility rate averages 33%, so each female produces on average of 4.6 fertile eggs annually (Adest <em>et al</em>. 1989). However, nest mortality from predation is about 87%, so only about six living hatchlings are produced over 10 years&#160;(Adest <em>et al</em>. 1989). Hatchling mortality during the first year is about 64% (Tom 1994), and hatchling and juvenile survivorship over the first few years is approximately 5%, so an average female will thus produce less than a single subadult offspring in a 10-year period of her reproductive life.<br/><br/>Bolson Tortoises prefer low grade slopes (0.5% to 2%) of fine textured soil (averaging 48% sand, 32% silt, 10% clay, 10% gravel), vegetated by mixed sclerophyll shrub and desert bunchgrass. These areas generally fringe basin floodplains. The area of occurrence is between 1,000 and 1,400 m altitude (Morafka <em>et al</em>. 1989). Bolson Tortoises are exclusively herbivorous, feeding on a variety of grasses, shrubs and herbs (Morafka 1982, Morafka&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1989).<br/><br/>Bolson Tortoises dig burrows up to 8 m long and 2 m deep as refuges from predators and extremes of weather conditions, and surface activity is correlated with rainfall and temperature. Aguirre <em>et al</em>. (1989) calculated that adult Bolson Tortoises spend less than 1% of their entire lives on the surface, either basking or feeding along well-established trails near the burrow. Burrows are constructed in social aggregations, and clusters show social structuring of individuals (Morafka <em>et al</em>. 1989, Becerra-López <em>et al</em>. 2014b). Radio-tracked juveniles preferred to excavate (or opportunistically use) burrows under <em>Opuntia</em> cacti (Tom 1994).","<p>Populations of <em>Gopherus flavomarginatus</em> are localized and disjunct. Three subpopulations represent moderately large reproducing subpopulations, and three further minor subpopulations exist. Total number of adults was estimated at a maximum of 7,000 to 10,000 in 1988 (Bury <em>et al</em>. 1988, based in part on Aguirre <em>et al</em>. 1984); they also divided the range of the tortoise into six districts and provided a list of known localities. Only in the last five years have efforts been made to revisit these localities and update population estimates. Recent revisits to 19 historic sites found that four no longer supported any tortoises and that three had increasing agricultural development that would soon extirpate the local populations. The total population is currently (2017) estimated to be 2,500 with approximately 2,000 within the Biosphere Reserve and another 500 in the remainder of the range (Becerra-López <em>et al</em>. 2014a, Ureña-Aranda <em>et al.</em> 2015, Palomo-Ramos and Kiester unpubl. data). Maximum known density in the 1980s was seven animals per hectare (Bury <em>et al</em>. 1988), but current density is estimated to be at the order of 1–2&#160; animals per hectare (Becerra-López <em>et al</em>. 2014a, Ureña-Aranda <em>et al</em>. 2015, Palomo-Ramos and Kiester unpubl. data). Thus, the total population has declined from an estimated 7,000-10,000 adults in 1998 to about 2,500 adults in 2017, a 64–75% decline over 30 years (less than one generation).&#160;</p>",Decreasing,Nearctic,Critically Endangered,2017-03-09 00:00:00 UTC
Geochelone elegans,"Indian Star Tortoises inhabit a variety of dry vegetation types, including scrublands, grasslands, desert edges and agricultural landscapes of fields, hedgerows and plantations (de Silva 2003; Fyfe 2007). Most localities occur under 200 m altitude, but records from 450 m and even as high as 900 m have been reported (Andrews, pers. comm., 2005). In Sri Lanka, this species occurs throughout the dry habitats up to 270 m altitude (Rathnayake, pers. comm., 2005). Indian Star Tortoises feed mainly on a variety of grasses, herbaceous, succulent vegetation and fruits supplemented with some animal matter (Das 1991; de Silva 2003).&#160;Choudhury and Rao (2005) recorded several species of indigenous plant that were preferred by Indian Star Tortoises in a soft release site in Andhra Pradesh.&#160;Adult males typically reach up to 26 cm and adult females typically up to 32 cm in carapace length (Moll 1989). Females attain sexual maturity at around 6-7 years of age (possibly earlier) (Das 1991; Vyas, pers. comm., 2005). However, in captivity this may be attained by the age of three years (Choudhury, pers. comm., 2005). Nesting seasons coincide with the monsoons that vary depending on the geographic location (e.g., May to June in western India, March to June and October to January in southeastern India) (Das 2002). Annually, females typically produce two clutches (exceptionally up to four clutches) comprising 2-10 eggs (exceptionally up to 24 eggs; Andrews, Choudhury, Vyas, pers. comm., 2005). Generation time has been estimated to be around 10 years (Choudhury, pers. comm., 2005). A detailed overview of natural history is presented by Das (2002), de Silva (2003), and Fyfe (2007).","<p>This species naturally inhabits scrub forests, grasslands, and some coastal scrublands of arid and semi-arid regions throughout its wide range (Das 2002), but also commonly inhabits &#160;human-dominated landscapes (Choudhury <em>et al</em>. 2000; de Silva 2003).&#160;Frazier (in Das 1991) recorded estimated densities of 4-12.5 animals per hectare in Gujarat. Populations in Sri Lanka are also generally considered common, although the 1998 Sri Lankan CAMP Assessment noted the species as declining and rated it Vulnerable A2cd.

Cuora bourreti,"<p><em><span lang=""EN-GB"">Cuora bourreti</em><span lang=""EN-GB""> inhabits upland, moist, closed-canopy evergreen forest, usually between 300 and 700 m altitude. The species is predominantly terrestrial and is not specifically associated with forest streams (Stuart and Platt 2004, Stuart <em>et al</em>. 2011; McCormack unpubl. data).&#160;<em>Cuora bourreti</em> is a medium-sized turtle, reaching up to 19-20 cm carapace length at a weight of about 800 to 1,200 grams. Males and females reach about the same size. Hatchlings measure about 45–50 mm and weigh 15–24 g. Extremely little is known of the biology of <em>C. bourreti</em> in the wild; most observations on diet, growth, and reproduction derive from animals maintained in captivity, either close to the species’ natural range, or in artificially manipulated captive conditions such as terrariums. Slow growth to maturity (10–15 yrs) is combined with low fecundity; in captivity a single clutch of 1–3 large eggs (55 x 30 mm) is seen each year in Cuc Phuong National Park where a small group is maintained (McCormack unpubl. data; T. Blanck unpubl. data). Similar clutch sizes of 1–3 eggs have been reported from long-term captive animals kept in Europe and North America (Fiebig and Lehr 2000, Struijk 2010).&#160;</span></p>","No absolute population size numbers or estimates are available for <em>Cuora bourreti</em>, and only anecdotal relative population density data. All recent indications are that the species requires extensive search effort to encounter. During field surveys in Lao PDR in 1993–1999, encounter rates were on the order of one turtle per three months in the field for a herpetologist, and one <em>Cuora galbinifrons</em> per day when working with a trained turtle hunting dog in prime turtle habitat (Stuart and Timmins 2000). A great deal of survey work has been undertaken in Viet Nam between 2009–2012 focused on determining the range and priority habitat for the&#160;<em>C. galbinifrons</em>&#160;group<em>, </em>with a focus on <em>C. bourreti </em>and <em>C. picturata.</em> Anecdotal information from interviews throughout the range has found that historic quantities of the species available for collection in the forest have been greatly reduced, with many hunters stating that while the species was common 7–15 years ago, it is now increasingly difficult to find. During surveys in 2006 in and around Song Thanh Nature Reserve, Quang Nam province, local hunters at that time claimed that numbers of <em>C. bourreti </em>had already been seriously depleted, from being able to catch 20 animals a day in the in the mid 1990s to only a few animals a week by 2006. However, the increasing economic value of the species by 2012 to an average of US$15.00 per kg is an increase from 2006, when surveys found an average value of US$9.00 around Song Thanh Nature Reserve, Quang Nam province. Similar reports of reductions in wild populations, and corresponding increases in wholesale prices paid, have been documented during interviews throughout the species range in Viet Nam (McCormack,&#160;unpubl. data).

Cuora picturata,"The only habitat details available in the literature are based on the locations of nine animals in three surveyed localities: these animals were encountered on the forest floor of broadleaf evergreen forest mixed with bamboo forest, at altitudes between 346 and 561 m elevation (Ly <em>et al</em>. 2011; Blanck <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;<em>Cuora picturata</em> is a medium-sized turtle, reaching at least 19 cm carapace length at a weight of up to 1100 grams (Ly <em>et al</em>. 2011; Blanck, unpubl. data). Males and females reach about the same size. Hatchlings measure about 45–50 mm and weigh 15–24 g. Extremely little is known of the biology of <em>C.</em><em>&#160;picturata</em> in the wild; most observations on diet, growth and reproduction derive from animals maintained in captivity, either within or close to the species’ natural range, or in artificially manipulated captive conditions such as terrariums. Mature females of&#160;<em>C. picturata</em> can produce a single clutch of 1–3 eggs each year, with large eggs&#160;measuring up to 60 x 35 mm (Blanck, unpubl. data).","<p>Population density of <em>Cuora picturata</em> is considered to be low. Ly <em>et al</em>. (2011) carried out field surveys throughout representative periods of the year, and required 15 days of a 4-person team with three trained hunting dogs (60 man-days, or 480 man-hours; 45 dog days or 360 dog hours) to encounter eight turtles, translating to 60 man-hours and/or 45 dog-hours per turtle. During a field survey in May 2012 in Deo Ca–Hon Nua Special Use Forest (a traditional collecting area in Phu Yen province, Viet Nam), a team of five dogs (four local hunting dogs and one trained survey dog) found only a single <em>C. picturata </em>and two <em>C. mouhotii </em>during a week of searching in which dogs were actively used over 21.7 km of transects (McCormack, unpubl. data; Blanck <em>et al</em>. 2016). Assuming that a team of dogs works a strip of a minimum width of 100 m, and finds half of all exposed and hidden turtles, this calculates to an estimated density of less than one<em> C. picturata </em>per sq. km, or one turtle per 280 dog hours. A great deal of survey work has been undertaken in Viet Nam between 2009–2012 focused on determining the range and priority habitat for the <em>C. galbinifrons</em> group<em>, </em>with a focus on <em>C. bourreti </em>and <em>C. picturata.</em> Anecdotal information from interviews concluded that historic quantities of the species available for collection in the forest have been greatly reduced, with many hunters stating that while these box turtles were common 7–15 years ago, they are now increasingly difficult to find. The overall extent of occurrence (EOO) of <em>C. picturata</em> is less than 25,000 sq. km, of which much is likely unsuitable as a result of being below or above suitable altitude, as well as large areas of                  suitable habitat at suitable elevation having been converted to agricultural purposes.&#160;The remaining area with suitable habitat (area of occupancy) for the species (AOO) is only about 3,000 km².&#160;The global surviving wild population is probably below 25,000 individuals, likely&#160;no more than 3,000-10,000 at best.</p>",Decreasing,Indomalayan,Critically Endangered,2015-07-01 00:00:00 UTC
Chersobius signatus,"<p>                      </p><p><em>Chersobius signatus</em>&#160;occurs predominantly in the winter rainfall region of the northwestern Succulent Karoo and Fynbos biomes along the West Coast and adjacent inland of South Africa. It is found from a few metres above sea level on the West Coast to elevations of around 1,000 m in the interior at Springbok, Loeriesfontein-Calvinia, and the Cederberg Range (Boycott 1989). The species shows a particular preference for rocky terrain (Loehr 2002a), which includes typical Namaqualand and Hardeveld granite koppies in the north, and typical Sandveld and Cederberg sandstone koppies and rocky ridges in the south. It occurs in low to medium-high Namaqualand succulent blomveld and heuweltjieveld, and fynbos and strandveld shrub vegetation, both in the Succulent Karoo and Fynbos biomes. The species prefers to shelter in rock crevices or under medium to large boulders and rock slabs (Loehr 2002a), a behavior that provides protection to these small tortoises against temperature extremes (Loehr 2017b) and predation.&#160;<em>Chersobius signatus</em>&#160;has very small home ranges (average 3,470 square meters = 0.35 ha) and short daily movement distances (30-50 m) compared to other tortoises (Loehr 2015).<br/><br/><em>Chersobius signatus</em> is a very small tortoise species: straight carapace lengths are 52-110 mm and 52-96 mm for females and males, respectively. Growth rates are higher for juveniles and females than for males, but growth rates are low and affected by rainfall. Females need 11-12 years to mature, which is substantially longer than expected for such a small tortoise (Loehr&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007a). <a>Generation time is estimated as 25 years</a>. During years of drought, individuals have low body conditions (Loehr&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007b) and experience negative growth (they can shrink), which holds serious consequences for female fecundity if the occurrences of drought intensify in the future (Loehr&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007a, 2009). Females produce one large egg (up to 11.9% of body volume) at a time and may lay more than one clutch during their nesting season in the spring. Rainfall influences egg production and fewer females are gravid in years of low rainfall (Loehr&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011).<br/><br/><em>Chersobius signatus</em>&#160;feeds on a broad range of plant species, which includes the flowers, leaves, and stems of forbs, grasses, succulents, and shrubs (Loehr 2002b, 2006). A 15-year study at a small site within a larger area with suitable habitat near Springbok indicated that the population consisted of <a></a><a></a><a>transient</a>&#160;and resident individuals, with a relatively high survival rate for adults, but slightly lower survival for females than for males (Loehr 2010, 2017a). It appeared that periodic droughts did not directly influence survival of juveniles and adults (Loehr 2010).&#160;<em>Chersobius signatus</em>&#160;basks for long periods to maintain relatively high body temperatures in the winter and spring, the time of the year when food is abundant. Females appear to have higher body temperature than males through most of the year, possibly to enhance follicle and egg development in winter and spring (Loehr 2012).</p><p></p>","<em>Chersobius</em><em>&#160;signatus</em> has a relatively small distribution and was previously known to be common in some areas. However, a long-term study in an area where the species used to be common showed that the resident population declined by 66% from 2000 to 2015, possibly due, in part, to increased predation by Pied Crows (Loehr 2017a). Field surveys in the early 2000s demonstrated the decline and finally extirpation of the species in many localities of its southwestern range, where it used to be common (E. Baard and M.D. Hofmeyr pers. obs.). The latter decline can be ascribed to substantial degradation of the habitat (Rouget <em>et al</em>. 2004), which has continued (Schoeman <em>et al</em>. 2013) due to overgrazing of the koppie habitats and transformation of the plains between the koppies. By virtue of the rock-dwelling behavior and specific habitat requirements (Loehr 2002a, 2012), and the small home ranges and short daily movement distances of the species (Loehr 2015), populations are highly fragmented, particularly in regions where low-lying habitat has been transformed. Population densities in most areas over the range of the species are low, and local populations are subjected to intense Pied Crow predation at several localities (M.D. Hofmeyr pers. obs.). The population near Pofadder requires further study to assess its extent and status.<br/><br/>In 2008, CapeNature and associates (University of the Western Cape) launched extensive surveys to update the population status of&#160;<em>C. signatus</em>&#160;in the southern and western part of its distribution range in the Western Cape Province. After visiting 22 localities where the species was known or suspected to occur, its presence was confirmed at 12 sites, including four new sites. These surveys indicated that the species was extirpated in some localities that previously had high population numbers and that extensive habitat degradation and destruction was placing remaining local populations under great threat (E. Baard 2015, unpubl. report to Turtle Conservation Fund). A follow-up survey by M.D. Hofmeyr (unpubl. data) showed that at least two more subpopulations in this southwestern region were extirpated within a short time period; the sites were overgrazed by goats with clear evidence of predation by Pied Crows.<br/><br/>Intermittent surveys in the northern range of the species between 2000 and 2015 (32 days) discovered only one site with a viable population; only one shell was recovered at another site (V. Loehr pers. obs.). Similarly, surveys above the escarpment (2000 to 2016) showed that the species is highly habitat-specific and usually occurs in low numbers (Hofmeyr unpubl. data). Over the range of the species, the frequency of predation by Pied Crows is increasing (Cunningham <em>et al</em>. 2016). The increased level of predation likely explains why a high-density population near Springbok declined by 66% over a 15-year period.",Decreasing,Afrotropical,Endangered,2017-06-06 00:00:00 UTC
Kinixys lobatsiana,"<em>Kinixys lobatsiana</em> is a savanna species that inhabits rocky hillsides in habitats of mixed <em>Acacia</em> and <em>Combretum</em> woodland, tropical Bushveld and Thornveld where vegetation ranges from dense, short shrubland to open tree savanna (Broadley 1989, Branch 2008, Boycott 2014). The species is sympatric with <em>K. spekii</em> over most of its range.&#160;<em>Kinixys lobatsiana</em>&#160;is omnivorous and apart from feeding on herbaceous plants, fruits and mushrooms, its diet includes beetles, snails, and millipedes (Branch 2008). Activity is highest during the summer rainfall season and it appears to brumate in abandoned animal burrows or rock crevices in winter (Branch 2008). In captivity, mating has been observed in summer and nesting in early autumn, with females having up to six eggs per clutch (Boycott and Bourquin 2000). The species is sexually dimorphic with females being larger and heavier than males (max. carapace length 200 versus 170 mm and max. body mass 1,500 versus 820 g; Boycott and Bourquin 2000). The elongated shell is dorso-ventrally flattened and the carapace has a broken rayed pattern (often absent in males) on a buff to brown background (Boycott and Bourquin 2000, Branch 2008). Broadley (1993)&#160;commented that South African&#160;<em>K. lobatsiana</em>&#160;have more distinct markings than tortoises from southeastern Botswana.","There is no direct information currently available on population numbers of <em>Kinixys lobatsiana</em>, but documented loss and degradation of available habitat suggest significant population declines.",Decreasing,Afrotropical,Vulnerable,2017-06-13 00:00:00 UTC
Chersina angulata,"<em>Chersina angulata</em>&#160;occurs from the coastal plains all along the escarpment to altitudes of 1,200&#160;m on the plateau. Its habitat in fynbos consists of open to dense fire-prone shrubland covered with ericoid and asteraceous shrubs, restios, and grasses. In the east, the range extends into Albany Thicket, which comprises dense semi-succulent and thorny vegetation, including large and small shrubs, geophytes, annuals, and grasses (Hoare <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2006). The species does not occur in dense thickets, but high population densities can occur in partially cleared areas (Branch 1989). A large portion of the habitat falls in the Succulent Karoo, which is dominated by dwarf succulent shrubs, with annuals, grasses, and geophytes. It is also found in the dwarf open shrubland of the Nama-Karoo. These tortoises prefer a sandy substratum in which they partially bury themselves when taking refuge under vegetation. Nevertheless, they also occur in rocky areas where they hide under large boulders or among rocks. <em>Chersina angulata </em>is medium-sized (maximum carapace length 35 cm) and distinguishable by its large, undivided gular scute. Its carapace is domed and the dorsal scutes are straw-coloured with dark centres and edges. Males are larger than females, which produce one egg at a time through most of the year (Hofmeyr 2004). Males and females reach sexual maturity at 10-14 years (M.D. Hofmeyr unpubl. data) and can potentially live for 50+ years. The diet is diverse and consists of angiosperms (mostly herbs and grasses), mosses, mushrooms, insects, snail shells, and animal faeces (Branch 1989, Joshua <em>et al</em>.<em> </em>2010). Although they are food generalists, they select dietary items out of proportion to availability (Joshua <em>et al</em>. 2010). Their metabolic rate plateaus between 26-38°C, which may indicate a thermal preference for summer foraging in the Eastern Cape (Setlalekgomo and Winter 2016a). The species has an endogenous circadian rhythm, suggesting it can, at least partially, thermoregulate physiologically (Setlalekgomo and Winter 2016b).","<em>Chersina angulata</em> is common in suitable habitat in South Africa, where it can reach densities of 30-35 individuals/ha (Branch 1984, Van Heezik <em>et al</em>. 1994).

Homopus areolatus,"<p><em>Homopus areolatus</em> is associated mainly with fynbos and renosterveld vegetation, but occurs also in open thicket in the Eastern Cape (Branch 2008). Relic populations in the southwestern interior are associated with fynbos or renosterveld inclusions in the Succulent Karoo Biome. The species occurs from sea level to elevations of 1,300 m in the interior, and prefers low but dense vegetation that provides protection against temperature extremes and predation. Annual rainfall over its range varies between 300 and 600 mm, but can be as high as 1,200 mm in the south. In the western region, winter rains prevail, but rainfall becomes non-seasonal towards the east.<br/><br/>Age of maturity is estimated as 8–10 years (M.D. Hofmeyr unpubl. data) and longevity can exceed 28 years (Boycott and Bourquin 2000).

Annual rainfall is low (approximately 150 to 400 mm over the species’ range) and relatively unpredictable with a coefficient of variation between 35 and 40% (Schulze 1997). Most of the range receives late summer rains. Temperatures are mild to hot and the incidence of frost is high in the interior. Occurs in dwarf shrubland that often contains succulent and grassy elements.

The species has some association with rocky terrain but individuals are most often found under vegetation in shrubland (V.J.T. Loehr pers. comm.). Consequently, it is not a habitat specialist like <em>H. (C.) boulengeri</em> and <em>H. (C.) signatus</em>. Little is known of the species' diet in the wild, but it feeds on a large variety of plants in captivity (Loehr 2009, 2012a).

Kinixys natalensis,"<p><em>Kinixys natalensis</em> prefers dry rocky habitat in thornveld, valley bushveld, dry thicket or bushveld savanna at elevations between 50 and 1,200 m and is generally absent from coastal regions, deep sand and forest (Boycott and Bourquin 2000, Bourquin 2004, Branch 2008, Boycott 2014). It is sympatric with <em>K. zombensis</em> in northern KwaZulu-Natal and with <em>K. spekii </em>in eastern Limpopo and Mpumalanga Provinces, as well as Swaziland. <em>Kinixys natalensis</em> is relatively small compared to other <em>Kinixys </em>species, with females reaching a shell length of 160 mm compared to 130 mm in males (Branch 2008). This is the only member of the genus that has a tricuspid rather than unicuspid beak (Broadley 1993). Tortoises are active when conditions are humid, overcast, and after rain, but seek shelter under rocks and in the foothills of mountains when inactive (Boycott 2001). There is little information on the biology of wild <em>K. natalensis,&#160;</em>but in captivity mating has been observed in February, followed by nesting, usually two eggs per clutch, in April and hatching in September (Boycott and Bourquin 2000). Hatchlings have a carapace length of approximately 35 mm and a mass of 8 to 10 g (Boycott and Bourquin 2000).

Caretta caretta,"The Loggerhead Turtle nests on insular and mainland sandy beaches throughout the temperate and subtropical regions worldwide. Like most sea turtles, Loggerhead Turtles are highly migratory and use a wide range of broadly separated localities and habitats during their lifetimes (Bolten and Witherington 2003). Upon leaving the nesting beach, hatchlings begin an oceanic phase in major current systems (gyres) that serve as open-ocean developmental grounds (Bolten and Witherington 2003, Putman and Mansfield 2015). After 4-19 years in the oceanic zone, Loggerheads recruit to neritic developmental areas rich in benthic prey or epipelagic prey where they forage and grow until maturity at 10–39 years (Avens and Snover 2013). Upon attaining sexual maturity Loggerhead Turtles undertake breeding migrations between foraging grounds and nesting areas at remigration intervals of one to several years with a mean of 2.5–3 years for females (Schroeder <em>et al</em>. 2003) while males would have a shorter remigration interval (e.g., Hays <em>et al</em>. 2010, Wibbels <em>et al</em>. 1990). Migrations are carried out by both males and females and may traverse oceanic zones spanning hundreds to thousands of kilometres (Plotkin 2003). During non-breeding periods adults reside at coastal neritic feeding areas that sometimes coincide with juvenile developmental habitats (Bolten and Witherington 2003).<br/><br/><strong><em>Generation length</em></strong><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria define generation length to be the average age of parents in a population (i.e., older than the age at maturity and younger than the oldest mature individual) and care should be taken to avoid underestimation (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). Although different subpopulations may have different generation length, since this information is limited we adopted the same value for all the subpopulations, taking care to avoid underestimation as recommended by IUCN (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).<br/><br/>Loggerheads attain maturity at 10-39 years (Avens and Snover 2013), and we considered here 30 years to be equal or greater than the average age at maturity. Data on reproductive longevity in Loggerheads are limited, but are becoming available with increasing numbers of intensively monitored, long-term projects on protected beaches. Tagging studies have documented reproductive histories up to 28 years in the North Western Atlantic Ocean (Mote Marine Laboratory, unpubl. data), up to 18 years in the South Western Indian Ocean (Nel <em>et al</em>. 2013), up to 32 years in the South Western Atlantic Ocean (Projeto Tamar unpubl. data), and up to 37 years in the South Western Pacific Ocean, where females nesting for 20-25 years are common (C. Limpus, pers. comm). We considered 15 years to be equal or greater than the average reproductive longevity. Therefore, we considered here 45 years to be equal or greater than the average generation length, therefore avoiding underestimation as recommended by IUCN (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).","Loggerheads are a single species globally comprising 10 biologically described regional management units (RMUs; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010) – hereafter subpopulations - which describe biologically and geographically explicit population segments by integrating information from nesting sites, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA studies, movements and habitat use by all life stages. Regional management units are functionally equivalent to IUCN subpopulations, thus providing the appropriate demographic unit for Red List assessments. There are 10 Loggerhead subpopulations: NorthWest Atlantic Ocean, North East Atlantic Ocean, South West Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, North East Indian Ocean, North West Indian Ocean, South East Indian Ocean, South West Indian Ocean, North Pacific Ocean, and South Pacific Ocean (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). Multiple genetic stocks have been defined according to geographically disparate nesting areas around the world and are included within RMU delineations (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010)  (shapefiles can be viewed and downloaded at: <a href=""http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot"">http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot</a>).<br/><br/>Total population size is unknown. The most common proxy for population abundance in sea turtles is the annual number of nests. A total of about 200,000 clutches are laid annually by the 10 subpopulations altogether (see Table 2 in the Supplementary Material).

Chelodina mccordi,"The habitat of <em>Chelodina mccordi</em>&#160;consists of small, shallow, eutrophic inland lakes, swamps, marshlands and adjacent agricultural rice paddies and fields (Rhodin <em>et al.</em> 2008). The species is reported to be entirely nocturnal, except during wet season rains. Reproductive ecology in the wild is largely unknown; female maturity may occur at about 10-11 years, similar to its Australian congener&#160;<em>Chelodina longicollis</em> (Kennett <em>et al</em>. 2009), giving a generation time estimate of about 15-20 years.&#160;In captivity, female maturity occurs at six years (Kayat and Saragih 2016), while a lifespan of about 30 years has been recorded from a wild specimen kept by local people on Roti (As-singkily, pers. obs.).

The diet of <em>C. mccordi</em> is apparently generalized carnivory or piscivory, with little dependence on hard-shelled bivalves or snails (Rhodin <em>et al</em>. 2008). In Timor-Leste, <em>C. mccordi timorensis</em>&#160;aestivates under dry grass near Lake Iralalaro, exposing individuals to collection and the threat of wildfires (Eisemberg <em>et al</em>. 2016).","Specimens of <em>Chelodina mccordi</em>&#160;were collected in large numbers from the populations on Roti from the early 1970s well into the 1990s; field surveys on Roti in 1993 revealed that the main mid-central island population was still reasonably robust but was under pressure due to collection for the international pet trade (Rhodin 1994; Rhodin <em>et al.</em> 2008).

Pelomedusa galeata,"<p><a><em>Pelomedusa galeata</em></a>&#160;is a large species of helmeted terrapin, with adults regularly reaching a straight carapace length (SCL) of 260 mm, and exceptionally up to 325 mm (Petzold <em>et al</em>. 2014). It occurs in fresh or stagnant waterbodies, including seasonal pans, flooded quarries and farm dams, and avoids mountainous terrain and forests (Boycott and Bourquin 2000). Rainfall is seasonal over the range of the species, with predominantly winter rains in the west and summer rains over central and eastern South Africa. Although it has been proposed that individuals aestivate during the dry season in both winter and summer rainfall regions (Boycott and Bourquin 2008), Stuart and Meakin (1983) found in a winter rainfall area that the terrapins disappeared during the coldest months and apparently bury themselves under vegetation away from water bodies. The species is known to move large distances overland and can remain in an inactive state for months or even years in arid regions (Boycott and Bourquin 2000).&#160;<em>Pelomedusa galeata</em>&#160;is primarily carnivorous but also ingests waterweeds and their roots (Boycott and Bourquin 2008). Females and males in the winter-rainfall region reach sexual maturity at 120-160 mm and 110-140 mm SCL, respectively (Strydom 2001). Mating usually occurs during spring with nesting from late-spring to autumn (Boycott and Bourquin 2000, Strydom 2001).&#160;Nest chambers of 18 cm depth and 9 cm width are excavated close to the water and clutches with up to 30, exceptionally up to 42, leathery eggs are laid. Eggs measure 25-40 mm by 18-30 mm and weigh 10-15 g.

In northern Sinaloa, Vargas (1994) reported that the species<em>&#160;</em>used packrat middens, dry cacti and even burrows dug by other animals (e.g. nine-banded armadillo,&#160;<em>Dasypus novemcinctus</em>). Our observations of&#160;<em>G. evgoodei</em>, during a nine-year radiotelemetry study near Alamos, Sonora, suggested that it uses several burrows a year and exhibits strong site-tenacity, returning to familiar dens year after year (Karl, unpubl. data). Tortoise activity corresponds with monsoonal rains and vegetation growth (Bury et al. 2002), and&#160;<em>G. evgoodei</em>&#160;is active from at least June well into November; there is little activity during the dry season (Karl unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Average age at maturity based on growth ring counts by Germano (1994) was estimated at 13.8 years for female tortoises from&#160;Sinaloa (=&#160;<em>G. evgoodei</em>), and 15.7 years in Sonora (= <em>G. morafkai</em>). However, an older age at maturity based on skeletal growth (Curtain <em>et al</em>. 2009) of 20 to 25 years for Sonoran tortoises (= <em>G. morafkai</em>) may be more accurate.

Heng Sovannara (pers. comm.) reported that over a five-year period (2002–2007) 23 nests were found on the Sre Ambel and Kaong Rivers, an average of 4.6 (range, 3–7) nests per year. However, only a single nest containing 23 eggs was found along the Sre Ambel in 2009 (Sovannara and Gately 2009).<br/><br/>In Thailand, Nutaphand (1979) reported that remnant river terrapin populations persisted in only three provinces, Phattalung, Songkhla, and Ranong. In a 1989–90 survey, Nutaphand found evidence that <em>Batagur</em> still occurred in two provinces near the Malaysian border, Phattalung (Pattharung) and Satun (Satoon) (Nutaphand 1990a, Moll 1990). Thirakupt and van Dijk (1994) and van Dijk and Palasuwan (2000) declared <em>B. affinis</em> to be extinct in the wild in Thailand, although Kalyar <em>et al</em>. (2007) reported a few wild individuals persist in the Klong Langu River.<br/><br/>In Malaysia, <em>B. affinis</em> was once very common on the major rivers throughout Peninsular Malaysia (Boulenger 1912, Moll <em>et a</em><em>l</em>. 2015). However, since the end of World War II the species has undergone a major decline and populations in the western river drainages are currently Critically Endangered. Exploitation of adult river terrapins in Malaysia has been less than in some countries of the region for several reasons. Islam, the predominant religion in Malaysia, teaches that the flesh of amphibious animals is “<em>haram</em>” (forbidden by religious law). Eggs, on the other hand, are considered a delicacy and thought to have aphrodisiacal properties. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, harvesting of “<em>tuntung</em>” eggs was the prerogative of royalty, and nesting beaches were protected from general exploitation. <br/><br/>The case of the Perak River population in Malaysia was likely typical of what occurred throughout the country during the War (Moll <em>et al</em>. 2015). Prior to 1940, the nesting terrapin population probably exceeded 10,000 turtles, and some 375,000 to 500,000 eggs were laid annually on Perak sandbanks (Loch 1951; Khan bin Momin Khan 1964; Moll 1978, 1980, 1985; Siow and Moll 1981; Moll and Moll 2004). However, during the Japanese occupation food was scarce and previously unexploited sources of protein (such as the river terrapin) were heavily utilized. By the end of the war, <em>B. affinis</em> populations had been decimated. A survey conducted in 1976 estimated the numbers of nesting females to be between 400 and 1200 and egg production on the Perak River at less than 20,000 per year (Moll 1980). In 1989–90 the river terrapin population on the Perak River laid 25,098 eggs in 923 nests. Depending on whether these turtles average one, two, or three clutches per year, this would place the number of nesting females at between 307 and 923 (Moll 1990). In 1990–91 20,608 eggs were laid in 849 nests, indicating between 283 and 849 females in the nesting population. In 1999, only 677 nests were reported. Hendrie (2004) visited nesting sites on three Malaysian Rivers in February of 2004. On the Perak River, he reported that only eight nests were found in 2003 and that 20 had been reported as of 2 February in 2004 (near the end of the nesting season). More recent data provided by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP) to E.H. Chan indicate no more than 40 wild nests were found from Perak River sand banks between 2005 and 2009. After 2009 no records of wild nests were available. Captive females at the Bota Kanan facility made 35 to 55 nests per annum between 2010–2013.<br/><br/>Also in Malaysia, on the Terengganu River, an island known as Pasir Lubok Kawah was for many years the most productive nesting beach for river terrapins. According to the staff at the Bukit Paloh Hatchery in Kuala Berang, an average of 60 females nested there annually from 1976 until 1987. Completion of a large dam upriver from the site in the early 1980s led to progressive erosion of the island until nesting suddenly plummeted with only seven females nesting there in 1988 and 1989 (Moll 1990, 1997). Due to the damage to nesting beaches along the Terengganu River, the hatchery and head-starting programme of the Terengganu Department of Wildlife and National Parks (DWNP) shifted some of its egg collecting to the Dungun River. However, recent data from the DWNP suggests a reversal of nesting decline on the Terengganu River. In 2008, 99 nests from 95 females were recorded, representing the highest nest numbers since river monitoring began in 1977 (Chan <em>et al</em>. 2008). These numbers have been maintained from 2009 to 2013, with numbers of nests ranging from 80 to 97 annually. In the Dungun River 30 to 49 nests have been recorded annually from 2009 to 2013 (DWNP data to E.H. Chan). The Setiu River in Terengganu has been monitored for nesting activity since 2004; Chan and Chen (2011) reported that from 2004–2009 the number of nests per year ranged from 17–30. This has dropped to no more than 10 in recent years. A newly discovered population in the Kemaman River has yielded 36–121 nests per year between 2012–2014 (P.N. Chen, unpubl. data).<br/><br/>Subpopulations no doubt historically occurred in the mangrove swamps surrounding Singapore, but are now evidently extinct (Lim and Das 1999, Ng and Lim 2010). Introduced subpopulations of unknown size are apparently present in several inland reservoirs; whether or not these animals are reproducing has yet to be determined (Ng and Lim 2010; B.D. Horne pers. obs.).<br/><br/>Relatively few localities are known for <em>B. affinis</em> in Indonesia, all of them from the eastern portions of Sumatra (Moll <em>et al</em>. 2015). Mistar <em>et al</em>. (2012) conducted surveys of North Sumatra, Riau, Jambi, and Lampung provinces along the eastern coast of Sumatra and concluded that although historically present, <em>B. affinis</em> is now most likely extirpated from this region. Habitat along the rivers of eastern Sumatra has been heavily impacted by human settlements and sand mining. However, terrapin eggs (presumably <em>B. affinis</em>) were available for sale in local markets in 2010, and according to information received from local fishers a remnant population of <em>B. affinis</em> may still persist in the Indragiri River and mangrove swamps around Mumpa (Enok District, Indragiri Regency).</p>        <p></p><p></p>",Decreasing,Indomalayan,Critically Endangered,2018-03-14 00:00:00 UTC

In 2005, the Chambal River subpopulation was estimated to produce about 150 nests annually (Sharma pers. comm. 2005). By 2010 it was understood to be doing well in a few rivers, representing about 40% of the overall range. It was listed as uncommon in Bangladesh in the 1990s (Rashid and Khan 2000), and by 2010 was considered so rare and depleted that it qualified as Critically Endangered (S.M.A. Rashid pers. comm. at Singapore Red List Workshop Feb. 2011). In the Chambal River, the species is now restricted to a ~100 km stretch, with ~500 nests recorded recently (S. Singh pers. comm. 2018).

Time to maturity about 18 years, based on captive-raised animals at the Lucknow Gharial Center, generation time well over 25 years.

Population status was considered indeterminate in India by Choudhury <em>et al.</em> (2000) as the species was elusive; severe declines were noted as requiring verification but are generally accepted as real (IUCN TFTSG and ATTWG 2000), being based on declining numbers of nests produced by the species (participants at Lucknow Red List Workshop, 2005). By 2010, its subpopulations in India were understood to be reduced to only a potentially viable subpopulation in the Chambal River, and possibly scattered individuals elsewhere in the range. (participants Red List Workshop Singapore Feb. 2011). In the past 12-13 years, no reliable records of&#160;<em>Batagur kachuga</em> are&#160;known except from the Chambal River. Its range has shrunk from most of Ganga to just Chambal; at Chambal the population of adult breeding females is estimated to be about 500. Status in Bangladesh was unclear, based on very few records (Rashid and Khan 2000), and considered extinct by 2010 (S.M.A. Rashid pers. comm. at Red List Workshop Singapore Feb. 2011).

Batagur trivittata,"<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Batagur trivittata</span> is a herbivorous freshwater turtle, which inhabits large rivers, and uses terrestrial nest sites on sandy banks. In historical times, some subpopulations nested on sandy sea beaches in the Ayeyarwady estuary. Age at maturity and longevity are unknown; by analogy with the similar <em>B. kachuga</em>, maturity may be as late as 15-20 years of age, and generation time is likely to be well over 25-30 years.","The Chindwin subpopulation of <em>Batagur trivittata</em> is estimated to comprise fewer than 10 adult females at the time of assessment. Persistence of the species was recorded for the Doke-tha-wady (tributary of the middle Ayeyarwady) in 2004, but the river section concerned has been dammed since then and follow-up surveys have failed to locate animals and there is no anecdotal indications of their continuing survival.&#160;A few adults are maintained in captivity in Mandalay. This represents a major total population reduction compared to the last available data from 1900 and 1935, when the species was still widespread and relatively abundant throughout its original range, with nesting aggregations of dozens to thousands of animals having been reported (Maxwell 1911, Theobald 1968,&#160;Smith 1931).",Decreasing,Indomalayan,Critically Endangered,2018-03-14 00:00:00 UTC

The Peninsular Malaysian subpopulation appears to be even more sparse, with only a few individual animals reported over the past 80 years. The species is considered very rare in Indonesia and is only recorded from accidental sightings. A recent targeted survey in 2014 in Jambi could not find the species (T. Lescher, unpublished report 2014).

Geoclemys hamiltonii,"<p><em>Geoclemys hamiltonii</em> prefers shallow, densely vegetated standing waterbodies, but may also occur in rivers, ponds and reservoirs and basks preferentially in reed beds (Das 1991). This species apparently feeds mostly on snails, taking also dragonfly larvae and other insects, freshwater crustaceans and a wide range of other vegetable and animal food items (Minton 1966, Das and Bhupathy in Das 1991, Rashid and Swingland 1997).<br/><br/>Animals may reach 40.5 cm carapace length, at a maximum weight of 6 kg. Females in Bangladesh averaged 30 cm (20.7-40.5, N=14), males are similar-sized averaging 29 cm (21.1-39.2 cm, N=13) (Rashid and Swingland 1997). Maturity in captivity may be reached after 6-8 (Gurley 2003) or 12 years (Artner 2006). Generation time was estimated at 20 years (Singapore Red List Workshop participants 2011).<br/><br/>Females reproduce during two distinct nesting seasons, with the second clutch usually a bit smaller than the first (Das 1991, Das and Bhupathy 2010); females produce clutches of 12-36 eggs (Bhupathy and Choudhury 1993, Basu and Singh 1998, Das 2001, Artner 2006). Hatchlings measure about 37 mm (Ewert 1979).</p>","<p>Status data on <em>Geoclemys hamiltonii</em> are highly variable, with the species considered common in several protected locations (e.g. Kaziranga) and reported as uncommon or rare at other sites, but on balance, Das (1991) considered the species rare. Choudhury <em>et al.</em> (2000) considered the species common in the Brahmaputra floodplains and rare elsewhere, and rated its population as apparently stable in India. By 2011, this situation was understood to have continued with populations still in good shape in protected areas, but rarely found outside. It is nearly extirpated outside protected areas in Assam (Ahmed and Das 2010).<br/><br/>In Bangladesh, the species was considered rare after an abrupt population decline in the past 20 years and total disappearance from extensive parts of its range in Bangladesh (Rashid and Khan 2000). By 2011, the species was considered to be more threatened than previously thought and estimated to have lost at least half its population since 1980, qualifying nationally as Endangered (M.A. Rashid pers. comm. at Singapore Red List Workshop, 2011).<br/><br/>In Pakistan, Akbar <em>et al</em>.

Indotestudo elongata,"<p>Elongated Tortoises inhabit primarily deciduous forest types (Sal, Dry Dipterocarp, Mixed Deciduous forests) with open, broken canopy allowing sufficient light for a moderate to very dense undergrowth of grasses and herbs; during the dry, leafless season animals may retreat to evergreen stream gallery forest. Records are mostly from hilly areas from low altitude to about 600 m altitude. In the Himalayas it has not been recorded over 500 m (M.F. Ahmed pers. comm. 2018). In Cambodia they are considered predominantly a lowland species in gentle sloping terrain. Local and seasonal movements are modest and seemingly random, tortoises apparently being confined to particular areas by features of habitat and topography (Moll 1989, Das 1991, van Dijk 1998).&#160;<em>Indotestudo elongata</em>&#160;is primarily crepuscular, with activity in the early morning and late afternoon, avoiding extremely high air temperatures of up to 48°C in the forest in the middle of the day. During periods of inactivity, tortoises retreat into dense vegetation, alongside fallen debris, in buttresses of trees, in caves or burrows. The species appears to have large home ranges (Ihlow <em>et al.</em> 2014), signifying a need for large areas of suitable habitat to be protected. Historically the species has benefited from disturbance of evergreen forest in northern Lao PDR and Viet Nam, as it prefers primarily deciduous forest types (R. Timmins pers comm. 2018).<br/><br/>Elongated Tortoises consume a wide diversity of foods, feeding mainly on soft leaves and fruits, while mushrooms, carrion and carnivore scats are eaten when available. (van Dijk 1998).<br/><br/>Elongated Tortoises of both sexes reach maturity at about 20 cm carapace length and a weight just over 1 kg, at an estimated age of 10-14 years (van Dijk 1998). Maximum size is usually 30 cm, but exceptional animals reach 35 cm carapace length. Hatchling size is approximately 4-5 cm (S. Schoppe pers. comm. 2018). Females produce one or possibly two clutches of 1-5 eggs towards the end of the rainy season (van Dijk 1998). Generation length is estimated to be a minimum of 30 years, but is likely to be substantially longer.&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<p>Despite having a wide distribution, and considerable suitable habitat remaining, severe population declines has occurred recently due to human activities (Ihlow <em>et al.</em> 2016). Scattered available information indicates that the species is depleted and now uncommon to rare throughout its range; survey findings consistently conclude that the species is rare and declining in India and Bangladesh (Moll 1989, Das 1991, Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2000). A 50-70% decline in population is believed to have occurred in the India/Bangladesh part of the range in the past 20 years (S. Singh pers. comm. 2018). There have been a few reports of <em>Indotestdo elongata</em> individuals in Bhutan's Royal Manus National Park but abundance is low there (Wangyal&#160;<em>et al. </em>2012).<br/><br/>The best subpopulations in Thailand were estimated to have a density of one or a few animals per km<sup>2</sup> (Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995, van Dijk 1998). The sex ratio in this population was also heavily female biased at 1:2.45 (van Dijk 1998). The species is somewhat abundant within protected areas in Thailand, but is collected for consumption outside of protected areas. Habitat destruction has led to a severe reduction in population in northeastast Thailand (M. Cota pers. comm. 2018).<br/><br/>In the latter part of the 20th century <em>I. elongata</em> in Lao PDR and Viet Nam were already scarce and localised (R. Timmins pers comm. 2018). Throughout most of Cambodia and parts of southern Viet Nam, the species was relatively widespread and common. Subpopulations in Lao PDR and Viet Nam and Cambodia have since been severely depleted and possibly locally extirpated.<em> Indotestudo elongata</em> is not uncommon in Myanmar, and subpopulations appear to be relatively stable (K. Platt pers. comm. 2018). In Bangladesh, <em>I. elongata</em> is relatively common in good habitat, but not in areas of habitat degradation (S.C. Rahman pers. comm. 2018). The species' survival is not compatible with human land use (other than responsible tourism in national parks) and will eventually become exclusively restricted to protected areas throughout its range. Overall, a population reduction of 80% is suspected to have occurred over the species range in the past three generations (90 years) as a result of habitat loss and harvest for food.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,Indomalayan,Critically Endangered,2018-07-01 00:00:00 UTC
Manouria emys,"<p><em>Manouria emys</em> exclusively inhabits evergreen forest, from lowland regions up to altitudes of about 1,000 m (typically 600-1,500 m). The animals appreciate moisture and are typically found near water and frequently burrow in damp soil (Nutphand 1979). Lambert and Howes (1994) radio-tagged a female at Danum Valley in Sabah. This animal ranged in an area of 0.6 km<sup>2</sup> during 53 days of almost daily observation, her locations generally clustering for several days followed by a long walk of up to about 300 m, followed by another period spent in a limited area. Wanchai (2008) found the species to utilise a range of habitats, including bamboo forest, dry evergreen forest mixed with bamboo, dry evergreen forest, stream courses and swampy stream edges. Juveniles are rarely observed more than 20 m from streams; adults are also generally close to streams except during the raining season when they are seen to forage at greater elevations (Wanchai 2008). During the dry season, most individuals become inactive for a period of up to two months, buried in litter or under tree falls.<br/><br/>The diet has been reported to include bamboo shoots, tubers and other juicy vegetation (Nutaphand 1979) and some invertebrates and frogs (Humphrey and Bain 1990). Lambert and Howes (1994) observed their radio-tagged female feeding on 19 occasions, eating predominantly green leaves of understory plants and mushrooms, as well as some seedlings, sometimes including the roots, and fallen figs (<em>Ficus punctata</em>) on one occasion.<br/><br/>Animals of the nominate subspecies can reach up to 50 cm carapace length and 20 kg, while subspecies <em>M. e. phayrei </em>reaches 60 cm carapace length and 37 kg (Nutphand 1979). Size and age at maturity have apparently not been reported.<br/><br/>The social behaviour of this species is quite complex, with elaborate dominance and courtship rituals (described in captivity and illustrated in detail by McKeown <em>et al.</em> 1990). Lambert and Howes (1994) noted (attempted) matings of their radio-tagged female at Danum Valley during 6-9 March and on 16 April by a different male; another mating was observed on 14 May. In captivity, a nest is constructed by the female by sweeping leaf litter backwards to form a nest mound. In this mound, a clutch of on average 35 (range 15-51, N=24) spherical or slightly elongate eggs (41-54 mm diameter, weight 46-80 g) is laid, with larger females typically produces more eggs. The nest is defended against potential predators by the female during the first few days.<br/><br/>In captivity,<em> M. e. phayrei</em> reaches sexuality maturity at about 15 years (Fahz 2010). Longevity of this subspecies has been recorded up to 20 years, but it is likely to be much longer (Slavens and Slavens 2000). Generation length is estimated at about 45 years (three times age of maturity).</p>","<p>Nearly all accounts of <em>Manouria emys</em> note it to be uncommon, rare or very rare, and declining: interviews indicated that forest labourers and hunter-gatherers in northeastern India and eastern Bangladesh would find between one and six animals per year, even when using dogs to find the tortoises; some of this information pertained to the 1980s (Das 1991, Choudhury <em>et al.</em> 2000). In 2018, the Singapore Workshop Participants considered <em>M. emys</em> overall Endangered in India, with a declining population trend. Recent records from India are only from Manipur, Mizoram, and Assam. Only three records of wild individuals have been reported in Assam since 2010, which have all been relocated to the zoo; and ten records from Manipur (S. Singh pers. comm 2018). It is considered Critically Endangered in&#160; Bangladesh and Myanmar (Participants, Singapore&#160;Red List Workshop 2011) and is apparently extirpated in the western side of Myanmar (K. Platt pers. comm. 2018). It was considered ‘rare’ in Indonesia by Samedi and Iskandar (2000) and very rare in Sumatra. It has been recorded in trade in Malaysia since 1989 and it was considered to occur most commonly in sparsely-populated hill and mountain areas.<br/><br/>Low collection rates of a few animals per year were reported by hill tribe hunter-gatherers in western Thailand in the early 1990s (Thirakhupt and van Dijk 1995). Taylor (1970) noted that ‘These large turtles are now becoming rare in Thailand'. In 2005, the species was assessed as Endangered in the ONEP Red Data. More recently, Wanchai's (2008) study in the well protected Kaeng Krachan National Park in Thailand found 15 individuals in a 1.5 km<sup>2</sup>, suggesting that relatively high densities may occur in appropriate habitat without human pressures. In central Borneo, the species is not rare in good forest habitats (I. Das pers. comm. 2018). In northeast India, the local communities are reporting fewer captured individuals for this species, although no data on population size or trends are available (M.F. Ahmed pers. comm. 2018). A few juvenile and adult individuals have been collected in the border of Bangladesh and Myanmar.<br/><br/>No population data appear to be available for the other portions of the species' range.<br/><br/>Participants of the Singapore Red List Workshop (2018) suspected over 80% reduction in population has occurred over the past three generations (135 years) and will continue for at least another generation due to exploitation pressures and reduction in area of occupancy as a result of habitat degradation.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,Indomalayan,Critically Endangered,2018-07-01 00:00:00 UTC
Lepidochelys kempii,"The Kemp's Ridley inhabits coastal areas throughout the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic coast of the United States (Hildebrand 1982, Pritchard and Marquez-M. 1973, Marquez 1994) (Figure 1 in Supplementary Information) (see Geographic Range for detailed range/distribution). Although the primary nesting beach is located in the western Gulf of Mexico (GoM) near Rancho Nuevo, Mexico, coastal areas throughout the GoM are important developmental and foraging habitat, as well as migratory corridors for reproductively active adults (Dobie <em>et al</em>. 1961; Hildebrand 1963, 1982; Ogren and McVea 1982; Marquez 1984; Hildebrand 1987; Ogren 1989; Witzell and Schmid 2005; Pritchard 2007; Shaver and Rubio 2008; Putman <em>et al</em>. 2013; Shaver <em>et al.</em> 2013,&#160;2016a, 2016b; Coleman <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2017). Additionally, the regular occurrence of juvenile Kemp's Ridleys in coastal areas along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. indicate that these areas also represent developmental and foraging habitats (Lazell 1980, Morreale <em>et al</em>. 1992, Musick and Limpus 1997). In addition to the coastal neritic habitats, the offshore (‘oceanic’) waters of the GoM and Atlantic Coast of the U.S. are also habitats for hatchling, post hatchling, and juvenile Kemp's Ridleys (Witherington <em>et al.</em> 2012, Putman <em>et al</em>. 2013, McDonald <em>et al</em>. 2017).

A variety of metrics can provide insight on the size and dynamics within a population.&#160; In the case of the Kemp's Ridley, the number of nests produced per year by this species represents an accurate metric for estimating the size of the adult population. Further, this metric has been has been consistently recorded for several decades in the Kemp's Ridley.<br/><br/>The current estimated number of mature individuals in the population (n=22,341) was calculated using the standard IUCN&#160; protocol for sea turtle Red List assessments. The calculation takes into account the total average number of annual nests from 2016–2018 (n=21,156; see Table 1 in Supplementary Information), an estimated clutch frequency of 2.5 clutches per year, an average remigration interval of 2.0 years, and a sex ratio of 3.17 females:1.0 males. All values are reviewed and reported in the Bi-National Recovery Plan for the Kemp's Ridley (NMFS <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>",Unknown,Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,Critically Endangered,2019-01-14 00:00:00 UTC
Emydoidea blandingii,"Blanding's Turtle uses a variety of permanent and temporary wetland habitats, with a preference for shallow clear standing water with abundant aquatic vegetation, but can be found in almost any waterbody in their area. The animals are highly mobile and move extensively between wetlands; nesting occurs in open grasslands, often well away from water.                 Animals leave strong scent trails, increasing their vulnerability to raccoon and fox predation. The species feeds mainly on crayfish and other small animal prey, but also scavenges and takes plant material and seeds.<br/><br/>Males reach 28 cm carapace length (CL), females 22 cm CL. Maturity is reached at about 12 years (20 cm CL) in males, and at 14–20 years (16–19 cm CL) in females. Longevity can be at least 77 years in the wild. Blanding's Turtle has been subject of arguably the most detailed population dynamics analysis of any turtle, documenting that animals mature at the age of 14 at the earliest, and generation times were calculated to vary between 36 and 47 years (Congdon <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2000, Ernst and Lovich 2009).<br/><br/>Females produce one or two clutches of 8–15 eggs (range 3–22, substantial geographic variation) in a reproductive year, but only half the females in a population may reproduce in a given year. Incubation takes about 82–96 (range 65–128) days, with substantial geographic variation. Hatchlings measure about 33 mm.<br/><br/> [Reviews available in Congdon <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2008), and Ernst and Lovich (2009)]","<p>Populations of Blanding's Turtle are often small and localized, with populations of a few dozen or hundred turtles, and densities ranging from 0.02 animals per hectare in Maine to 28/ha in Wisconsin, 55/ha in Missouri, and up to 57/ha in Nebraska. The largest known population, in Nebraska, is estimated at over 130,000 animals, excluding hatchlings and yearlings (Lang 2004). In contrast, Pennsylvania populations may total a few dozen individuals. Populations in Illinois and Ohio are perceived to be in ongoing decline, possibly associated with increased predation by raccoons (D. Mifsud, pers. comm. 2009).</p><p> Some populations appear stable over time, while others were documented as declining (Brodman <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2002, Smith <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Summaries of these can be found in Congdon <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. (2008) and Ernst and Lovich 2009.</p>  <p>Participants at the MidWest USA Turtle RL WS estimated that 30–50% of suitable habitat and the populations they contained have been lost in recent decades, while many remaining populations have reduced in size.</p>",Decreasing,Nearctic,Endangered,2010-08-01 00:00:00 UTC
